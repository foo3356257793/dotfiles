# Help needed for our Masked Singer activity

Hello youth and parents of youth!

Next Tuesday we will be having a combined YW/YM activity where we will be having our own version of the Masked Singer! We will be hearing the musical talents of some members of our ward but will we be able to guess who they are? 

To make it the best activity possible we need your help! We are looking for participants to share musical talents. Can you sing? Play the piano? Play the kazoo? We would love to have you participate! And if the thought of performing in front of a large group makes you a little nervous, don't worry! Everyone will have their screens off, including you!
