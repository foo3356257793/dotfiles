Had a pleasant day of work.

Did soccer with Anna tonight.

Paid tithing; it had been over a year since we had paid it, which is
really bad; we paid out over $16,000 tonight.
This realization also put a damper on our financial situation.  I am
starting to stress more about what we are going to do to keep in the
black.

I had been thinking about computers and whether to buy a new
computer.  In the process I realized that we had some old laptops
which we hadn't used in a while.  I bought a replacement charger for
my old laptop ($11) and it arrived today.  I have been playing
around with it tonight.  It might work out to be an asset.  I have
been utilizing our monitor more and more, and with a keyboard and
mouse it is actually quite pleasant.  I recalled that my old laptop
had been upgraded with an SSD and 8 gigs of ram, which is better
than the Mac Mini we had been using.  I still need to do some
cleanup on the Mac and get ready to sell it.
