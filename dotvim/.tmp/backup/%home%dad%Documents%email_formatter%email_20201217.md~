# Update on Youth Activities

Hello Young Women and parents,

Last night we received word from the Stake Presidency that effective
immediately all in-person youth activities will be cancelled
until at least January 13th.

We have decided that due to the holidays we will
cancel our activities for December 22nd and 29th. We are planning to hold Zoom
activities on January 5th and 12th.

Thank you for your understanding in this matter.  We have enjoyed seeing each
other every week!
However, we support our Stake Presidency as they
do their best to keep our youth safe in light of the current public
health crisis.

We love you and hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and New Year!

Love,

The YW presidency
