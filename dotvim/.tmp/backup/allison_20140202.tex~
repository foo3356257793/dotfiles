% \maketitle


Two weeks ago last night the sister missionaries were over to our
house for dinner and they showed us a Mormon message.  Elder Richard
G. Scott spoke of two different techniques to scale a rock cliff.
First is showed one man who was using a method called free soloing,
going up alone without any equipment or companions.  He had no
safely system in place to catch him if he were to slip.  Then they
showed a group of people with rope and carabeners and proper gear to
safely ascend the wall. There were many different lessons to be
learned from this short video but one that stuck with me was that if
we try to live this life on our own, we will probably fail, but if
we use the tools a loving Heavenly Father has put in place for us,
we will have a secure anchor to help us successfully navigate this
life.  The message stuck with me.  Fast forward to the next day when
the Bishop calls me and my husband into his office and extends the
calling to be Relief Society President.  I was overwhelmed to say
the least.  Look at all the superwoman that Jill is and it seemed
really daunting.  Of course I accepted but it weighed heavily on me.
I couldn't help but think of the Mormon message from the night
before. I had the epiphany that I cannot try to do it alone.  I have
to enlist the help of the counselors and members.  

I need to have the Holy Ghost, one of the greatest resources the
Savior has given us to scale this mountain.  Started to worry about
how to have the Spirit strong enough in my life.  How could it
happen? Life gets crazy and I slip.  I have weaknesses.  I make
mistakes.  I can't turn myself into a nun just like a person going
on a crazy diet to lose weight.  I needed something sustainable that
I am capable to maintain.  How can I make myself worthy of the
Spirit?   
 
Small and simple things

\begin{itemize}
	\item Diamond
	\item Diploma
	\item Human being
	\item Tree
	\item Building
	\item Concert pianist
	\item Running shoes
	\item Book
\end{itemize}

What do all these things have in common? They all start with small
and simple things.  None of these things happen over night.  The
process for each of these is painstakingly slow but the end result
is phenomenal.  

\subsection*{Alma 37:6-7}

Why is this such an important principle?  Why is it so easy to
forget it?

So the Lord does not require us to be perfect overnight but He does
require us to progress.  He requires us to improve.  

\subsection*{Parable of the Piano Lessons}

Christ's arrangement with us is similar to a mom providing music
lessons for her child. Mom pays the piano teacher. Because Mom pays
the debt in full, she can turn to her child and ask for something.
What is it? Practice! Does the child's practice pay the piano
teacher? No. Does the child's practice repay Mom for paying the
piano teacher? No. Practicing is how the child shows appreciation
for Mom's incredible gift. It is how he takes advantage of the
amazing opportunity Mom is giving him to live his life at a higher
level. Mom's joy is found not in getting repaid but in seeing her
gift used—seeing her child improve. And so she continues to call for
practice, practice, practice.

If the child sees Mom's requirement of practice as being too
overbearing (“Gosh, Mom, why do I need to practice? None of the
other kids have to practice! I'm just going to be a professional
baseball player anyway!”), perhaps it is because he doesn't yet see
with Mom's eyes. He doesn't see how much better his life could be if
he would choose to live on a higher plane.

In the same way, because Jesus has paid justice, He can now turn to
us and say: “Follow me” (\textbf{Matthew 4:19}); “Keep my
commandments” (\textbf{John 14:15}). If we see His requirements as being way
too much to ask, maybe it is because we do not yet see through
Christ's eyes. We have not yet comprehended what He is trying to
make of us.  Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve
Apostles has said, “The repenting sinner must suffer for his sins,
but this suffering has a different purpose than punishment or
payment. Its purpose is change” (The Lord's Way [1991], 223;
emphasis in original). Let's put that in terms of the child pianist:
The child must practice the piano, but this practice has a different
purpose than punishment or payment. Its purpose is change.

The miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can live after we
die but that we can live more abundantly (see \textbf{John 10:10}). The
miracle of the Atonement is not just that we can be cleansed and
consoled but that we can be transformed (see \textbf{Romans 8}).

\subsection*{His Grace Helps Us}

“But don't you realize how hard it is to practice? I’m just not very
good at the piano. I hit a lot of wrong notes. It takes me forever
to get it right.” Now wait. Isn't that all part of the learning
process? When a young pianist hits a wrong note, we don't say he is
not worthy to keep practicing. We don't expect him to be flawless.
We just expect him to keep trying. Perfection may be his ultimate
goal, but for now we can be content with progress in the right
direction. Why is this perspective so easy to see in the context of
learning piano but so hard to see in the context of learning heaven?

There should never be just two options: perfection or giving up.
When learning the piano, are the only options performing at Carnegie
Hall or quitting? No. Growth and development take time. Learning
takes time. When we understand grace, we understand that God is
long-suffering, that change is a process, and that repentance is a
pattern in our lives. When we understand grace, we understand that
the blessings of Christ's Atonement are continuous and His strength
is perfect in our weakness (see \textbf{2 Corinthians 12:9}). 

Grace is not a booster engine that kicks in once our fuel supply is
exhausted. Rather, it is our constant energy source. It is not the
light at the end of the tunnel but the light that moves us through
the tunnel. Grace is not achieved somewhere down the road. It is
received right here and right now.

\subsection*{Grace Is Sufficient}

The grace of Christ is sufficient (see \textbf{Ether 12:27}; 
\textbf{D\&C 17:8})—sufficient to cover our debt, sufficient to
transform us, and sufficient to help us for as long as that
transformation process takes. The Book of Mormon teaches us to rely
solely on “the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah”
(\textbf{2 Nephi 2:8}). As we do, we do not discover—as some
Christians believe—that Christ requires nothing of us. Rather, we
discover the reason He requires so much and find the strength to do
all He asks (see \textbf{Philippians 4:13}).  Grace is not the
absence of God's high expectations. Grace is the presence of God’s
power (see \textbf{Luke 1:37}).

God's grace is sufficient. Jesus’s grace is sufficient. It is
enough. It is all we need. Don't quit. Keep trying. Don’t look for
escapes and excuses. Look for the Lord and His perfect strength.
Don't search for someone to blame. Search for someone to help you.
Seek Christ, and, as you do, you will feel the enabling power and
divine help we call His amazing grace.
