Need to find the ordinary generating function.

$$
A_G = \sum_n G_n x^n
$$

We get

$$
(1-x-x^2)G = G_1x + (G_2-G_1)x^2 + (G_3-G_2-G_1)x^3 + \cdots + (G_n - G_{n-1} - G_{n-2})x^n + \cdots
$$
Most of these terms are $0$, so we just have
$$
(1-x-x^2)G = x + (4-1)x^2 = x(1+3x)
$$
Hence
$$
G = \frac{x(1+3x)}{1-x-x^2} \; .
$$

_next_.
Let $x=p/q$.  Then
$$
G =
\frac
{
(p/q)(1+3p/q)
}
{
1-p/q - (p/q)^2
}
=
\frac{p(p+3q)}{q^2 - p q - p^2}
$$
We want to show that the denominator must be equal to $1$.
Let $r$ divide the denominator.  If $r|q$, then
$$
q^2-pq-p^2 = -p^2 = 0 \bmod{r}
$$
which is a contradiction.  Otherwise,
$$
q = -3p \bmod{r}
$$
$$
(-3p)^2-p(-3p)-p^2 = p^2 (9 + 3 - 1) = 11 p^2
$$
We could see this from the resultant.

Therefore the denominator is either $1$ or $11$.

Want to solve
$$
q^2 - pq - p^2 = 1,11
$$

## Again

$$
F = x*(1+3*x) / (1-x-x^2)
$$
This gives
$$
n(1-x-x^2) = 3x^2 + x
0 = (n+3)*x^2 + (1+n)*x - b
$$
so
$$
x = (-(1+n) \pm \sqrt{(1+n)^2 + 4(n+3)n}) / (2*(n+3))
$$
this works iff
$$
(1+n)^2 + 4(n+3)n
$$
is a square.

$$
5n^2 + 14n^2 + 1 = y^2
$$
