* DONE

  *Headers*. I can get rid of these.  I also tweaked these to be really small
  so that I at least have the option of using them.

  See .config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css

  Super+Drag is a way to move windows.  Easy with the trackpoint.
  I also have snapping:
    - Super+h/l: Snap left or right
    - Super+k: Maximize
    - Super+j: Restore

  *move window*.
    - Super-m puts in move window mode
    - Super-r puts in resize window mode
    - shift-arrow does large chunks of movement
    - It would be nice to have keyboard shortcuts to do moves

* TODO

Widget for timers

Customize keyboard shortcuts nicely
  - Have made some progress
  - Rethink workspace nav shortcuts (still use ctrl-alt?)

Need to learn chrome shortcuts better
  - ctrl-t         : open new tab and start typing
  - ctrl-w         : close tab
  - ctrl-tab       : goto tab left
  - ctrl-shift-tab : goto tab right
  - alt-arrow      : go back/forward in browsing history

move window with keyboard: the arrow keys move it so slowly
  - shift seems to make it move in chunks

be able to print from system utils
  be able to scan???

customize the login screen

tmux config
  - not as important on a machine where I can just open multiple terminals?

* BACKBURNER


look into anbox for android apps
- or don't: this doesn't seem to be that great
