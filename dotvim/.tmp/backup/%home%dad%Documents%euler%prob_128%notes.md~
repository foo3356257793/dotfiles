What is a formula for the difference set?

The length of the rings:

$$
1,
6,
12,
18,
$$
The pattern looks like multiples of $6$.

There are $6$ sides.  Each ring has the same number of tiles
per side.  There are $6$ corners.  This gives the multiples of $6$.


# Differences

What is the formula of differences?

The ring starts are

$1, 2, 8, 20, ...$

$1, 2, 2 + 6, 2 + 6 + 2*6, ..., 2 + 3*n*(n+1)$

Two of the neighbors are things on the same ring (mostly consecutive numbers).

We have corners and non-corners.

There are $6$ kinds of non-corners.


 A B
F   C
 E D

Examine the neighbors of the non-corners:

A:
$$
k-1, k+1, k - lower_ring_length, k + ring_length, k+1+ring_length, k-1-lower_ring_length
$$
B:
$$
k-1, k+1, k - ring_length, k + upper_ring_length, k + 1 - ring_length, k-1+upper_ring_length
$$
C:
$$
k-1, k+1, k-1-ring_length, k-2-ring_length, k-1-upper_ring_length, k-2-upper_ring_length
$$
D:

## Brute force?

Maintain a list of nodes and neighbors.

Have a list of ring starting points.  Start by stacking a node on top of the starting point.  Then move counter-clockwise adding new nodes.  These nodes attach to the previous as well as to the node below them.

This is actually simple; the node which gets attached to the below node simply increments.  At a corner, we don't increment.

## Results

I wrote code to go through it with brute force.  It is too slow to get up to the level required.


### Things we can rule out

A side connection is connected to consecutive values in the outer ring, middle ring, inner ring.  This ends up with a max of $2$.  We can ignore these.

The only exception is the one next to the first corner.

On the corners, what happens?  Except for the first corner, rule out neighbors on the same ring.

The connection of the corner to the inner ring increments by $1$.

Here are the pairs of these
$$
(6,12), (7,13), (8,14), (9,15), (10,16), (11,17)
$$
So we are looking at pairs $(i, 6+i)$.

*Cases*.

Sides (not along start): no
Corners (not along start):
$(n,n+5,n+6,n+7)$
How many of these can be prime?
If $2|n$, then only $n+5,n+7$ can work, which rules it out.
If $1|n$, then only $n,n+6$ can work, which rules it out.

Starts:
The above and below are multiples of $6$.
We have a connection $6n-1$.
Also $6n+1$, $6n+1+6(n+1)-2=12n+5$.

Example: $8$ at $n=2$ has $11,13,29$.

Ends:
Have a connection $6n-1$.
$6(n-1)+6n-1 = 12n-7$.
We have $6n$ which is not prime.
we have $1$ which is not prime.
We have $6(n+1)$ and $6(n+1)-1$.
So we are looking for
$$
6n-1, 6n+5, 12n-7 \; .
$$
