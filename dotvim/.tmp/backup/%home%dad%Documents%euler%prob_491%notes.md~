Since $10 = -1 \bmod{11}$, divisibility by $11$
is checked by summing the digits with alternating signs.

**Question**.
How many pandigital numbers?

$$
20! / 2^10 \approx 2^{51} \; .
$$

We cannot just exhaust these.


How many partitions into two subsets?

Upper bound

$$
binomial(20,10) \approx 2^{17}
$$

We could exhaust these.

*note*.
The sum of all digits is $0+1+\cdots+9 = 45$.
Need the sum of each partition to be $45$.

*next*.
There are not that many valid partitions.

Look through each partition and decide how many reorderings.

## next

I enumerated all pairs.
Now I need to figure out how many numbers these pairs generate.

_note_ The number of ways to permute one half is equal to the
number of ways to permute the other half.

## Leading zeros

How do we count the number of permutations which have no leading zero?

If there is one zero, we can place it in $9$ positions.  We then have $9!$
ways to fill the other positions.

## Error

We have

$O - E = 0 \bmod{11}$.

We have $O + E = 90$.
