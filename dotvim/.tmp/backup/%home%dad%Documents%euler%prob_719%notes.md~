# Notes

Need to split off one value which is half of the digits.
Might need to have an even number of digits.

Note that the LHS is equivalent to the square mod $9$.
This implies $x \equiv x^2 \bmod{9}$.
Hence we are looking for $x \in \{0,1\}$ modulo $9$.

The bound $n \leq 10^{12}$ is not bad because we are looking
at squares.  The mod $9$ condition is also helpful.

We need a function to figure out if we have an $S$ number.

One thing to try is to look at subsets of the digits which sum to
the correct answer modulo $10$.  We can do this with a meet in the middle approach.
