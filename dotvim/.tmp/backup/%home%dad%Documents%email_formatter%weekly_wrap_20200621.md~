# Girls' Camp

GIrls' Camp is finally here! We are so excited to learn and grow together this week through all the fun and uplifting activities that have been planned. The stake bag contains all that you will need and the ward bag will have unity items that you can wear every day to represent the awesome Broadneck ward. Here's a reminder of the items for the Broadneck unity days:

  * **Tuesday**: star tattoos on your face
  * **Wednesday**: tie-dye t-shirts
  * **Thursday**: football glitter lines under eyes, adhered with chapstick
  * **Friday**: ribbon in your hair

If you have any questions, issues, or concerns, please contact a member of the YW Presidency (see contact info below).

  We are so blessed to have you, the Young Women, lead our Sunday discussions.  We have created a sign-up sheet that you can choose which date works best for you to lead a discussion.
  The sign-up sheet will cover the rest of the year so please sign up for two slots in your respective group: middle school or high school.  

  We are also blessed to have two wonderful advisors: Sister Bullough who will work with the Middle School group and Sister Fairbanks who works with the High School group. They are happy to offer you any support you may need.

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women! Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November 15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with
[this one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe
Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.

# June Birthdays

* Isabelle Weaver (11th)
* Mackenna Denyer (21st)
* Keren Millett (26th)
* Kezia Millett (26th)
