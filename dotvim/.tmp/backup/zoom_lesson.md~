# Alma 5:14--33

**We must experience---and continue to feel---a mighty change of heart**

There were questions in Alma 5:14--33.
Are these meaningful to our class?

# Alma 5:44--51

**We can gain our own witness of the Savior and His gospel through the Holy Ghost**

The manual has people write a "recipe" for a testimony.

*Additional resources*.

Here are steps to gaining a testimony.

1. A desire to believe.
2. Search the scriptures.
3. Do the will of God; keep the commandments.
4. Ponder, fast, and pray.


# Alma 6

**We gather as Saints to hear God's work and do His work**

Imagine someone we know thinks that church is not necessary.

Alma 6 has some of the blessings of belonging to church.

v. 5. Hearing the word of God.
v. 6. Fasting and prayer "in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God".

# Alma 7:7--16

**The Savior took upon Himself our sins, pains, and afflictions.**

How does the Savior actually help us?
