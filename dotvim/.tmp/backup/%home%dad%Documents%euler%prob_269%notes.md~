# Ideas

Polynomials with at least one integer root.

The roots need to be non-positive.

Multiples of $10$ have a root at $0$.
So $Z(100000)$ is at least $10000$.
There are then $4696$ for the other roots.

Next, consider roots at $-1$.
This happens for when the odd coefficients sum
to be equal to the even coefficients.

# Idea

We can find polynomials with a root $-a$ as follows:

1. For $r=-1$, inductively find the distribution of $P_n(-1)$ by number of digits.

2. For $r=-a$, $a>1$, the same, except through out results which fail the modular condition.

3. Figure out overlapping conditions.  **Expensive?** Keep track of a distribution of pairs $P_n(-a), P_n(-b)$.  Need to keep track of increasing levels of overlap.

Possible root sets: singles,
$$
[-2,-2], [-2,-3], [-2,-4], [-2,-2,-2], [-3,-3]
$$
and any number of $-1$ adjoined with these.
This is because the constant coefficient is the product of roots.

(Not that bad because using $a>1$ gives a cutdown?)
