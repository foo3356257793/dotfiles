\section{Problems I Was Working On}

\subsection{Left Nullstellensatz for Non-Finitely-Generated Ideals}

\emph{Latest:} Here is a counterexample to the non-finitely generated case.
Let $I$ be generated by the set
\[ \{ x_1(x_2^*x_2)^dx_3 \mid d \geq 1\}.\]
In short, looking at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $X_2^*X_2 \succeq 0$,
if $(X,v) \in V(I)$, then we need to have $X_1X_2^*X_2X_3v = 0$.

\emph{Latest \#2:} It's also true that if $X$ is a tuple of bounded operators
on a Hilbert space then we can get this example to work. (use
Spectral Theorem and Stone-Weierstrass; this is related to the
Lance-Tapper conjecture).

\subsection{Hard Nullstellensatz}

Let $I \subset \FF\axs$ be a (two-sided) ideal.
Let $\sqrt[n]{I}$ be defined by
\[ \sqrt[n]{I} := \cI(V(I)^{(n)}),\]
and
\[ \sqrt{I} := \cI(V(I)) = \cI\left( \bigcap_{n \in \NN} V(I)^{(n)} \right).\]
Then ??Fix??
\[ \sqrt[n]{I} = \bigcap_{\substack{J \supseteq I\\ J \mbox{ real}\\
\dim(\FF\axs / J) \leq n}} J\]
and
\[ \sqrt{I} = \bigcap_{n \in \NN} \sqrt[n]{I} =
\bigcap_{\substack{J \supseteq I\\ J\mbox{ real}\\ \dim(\FF\axs
/ J) < \infty}} J.\]

The $\sqrt{I}$ part is really easy to prove.

The $\sqrt[n]{I}$ case will take more thought.
If we mean $\bigcap_J Z(J)$ such that $J$ is a real left ideal with
$\dim(\FF\axs/J) \leq J$, then this is correct.

\subsubsection*{Conjecture}

Suppose that $I$ is generated by analytic polynomials.
If $I \neq \FF\axs$, then $\sqrt[\hard]{I}$ is equal to
$I$ if and only if
$1 + \text{commutators} \not\in I$.

I know that if $1 + \text{commutators} \in I$, then $\sqrt[\hard]{I} = \FF\axs$.

\begin{proof}
If $I \subset J$, and $0 < \dim(\FF\axs / J) < \infty$, then we can
build a tuple of matrices easily such that $\vartheta(X) = 0$ if and only if
$\vartheta \in J$.  If $1 + \sum_i^{\fin} p_i q_i - q_i p_i \in I$, then this
implies that
\[ \tr\left(I_n + \sum_i^{\fin} p_i(X) q_i(X) - q_i(X) p_i(X)\right) = n,\]
which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

Suppose $I \subset J$, and $0 < \dim(\FF\axs / J) < \infty$, and $pq - qp - 1
\in I$.  This implies that $f(p) \in J$ for some commutative polynomial $p \in
\FF[x_1]$.  It is straightforward to verify that
\[ f(p)q = qf(p) + f'(p),\]
which implies that $f'(p) \in J$.  Taking this all the way down, we see that $1
\in J$.

\emph{Example}:
\[ X=\begin{bmatrix}
      0&0&0\\1&0&1\\0&0&0
     \end{bmatrix}
\quad \mbox{and}
\quad
Y=\begin{bmatrix}
      0&0&0\\0&0&0\\1&0&1
     \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives $XY-YX-X = 0$ but $X \neq 0$.

\subsubsection{Known Properties}

\begin{prop}
For any hard radical ideal $I$, the following hold
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $I$ is a $\ast$-ideal
 \item Whenever
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sosPlusCom}
\sum_i^{\fin} p_i^*p_i + \sum_j^{\fin} (q_jr_j - r_jq_j) \in I,
\end{equation}
for some $p_i, q_j, r_j$, then each $p_i \in I$.
 \item Whenever
\[
 pq - 1 \in I
\]
for some $p,q$ then $qp - 1 \in I$ as well.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
 If $X \in V(I)$, and $p \in \cI(V(I)) = I$, then $p(X) = 0$,
which implies that $p(X)^* = 0$.  Therefore $p^* \in I$.  This
gives (1).

For (2), suppose (\ref{eq:sosPlusCom}) holds.  Then if $X \in V(I)$, we see
\[
 \sum_i^{\fin} p_i(X)^*p_i(X) + \sum_j^{\fin} (q_j(X)r_j(X) - r_j(X)q_j(X)) = 0.
\]
Therefore
\[
 \operatorname{Tr} \left( \sum_i^{\fin} p_i(X)^*p_i(X) + \sum_j^{\fin}
(q_j(X)r_j(X) - r_j(X)q_j(X))\right) \]
\[= \sum_i^{\fin}
 \operatorname{Tr} \left(  p_i(X)^*p_i(X)\right) = 0,
\]
which implies that each $p_i(X) = 0$.  Therefore each $p_i \in I$.

For (3), suppose $pq - 1 \in I$.  If $X \in V(I)$, then $p(X)q(X) -
\operatorname{Id} = 0$, where $\operatorname{Id}$ denotes the identity matrix
of proper dimension.  Therefore $p(X)$ and $q(X)$ are inverses of each other,
so $q(X)p(X) = \operatorname{Id}$ as well.  Therefore $qp - 1\in I$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Alternate Proof of (3)]
Suppose $pq -1 \in I$.
 Suppose $I \subset J$, where $J$ is an ideal with finite co-dimension.
The finite co-dimension assumption implies that there exists some polynomial in
$q$ in $I$, that is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:plyInQ}
 q^n + a_{n-1} q^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0 \in I
\end{equation}
for some scalars $a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1}$.
Assume that (\ref{eq:plyInQ}) is the smallest polynomial in $q$ appearing in
$I$. If $1 \not\in J$ then this minimal polynomial has positive degree.
We see
\begin{align}
\notag
p(q^n + a_{n-1} q^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0)
&= (pq)(q^{n-1} + a_{n-1} q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1) + a_0p\\
\notag
& = (pq - 1)(q^{n-1} + a_{n-1} q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1)\\
\notag
& \quad + q^{n-1} + a_{n-1}
q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0p.
\end{align}
If $a_0 = 0$, then this implies that the polynomial
\[
 q^{n-1} + a_{n-1}
q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 \in I,
\]
which contradicts our minimality assumption.
Therefore $a_0 \neq 0$.

We then see
\begin{align}
\notag
q (q^{n-1} + a_{n-1}
q^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 p)
&= q^{n} + a_{n-1}q^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 q + a_0qp\\
\notag
& = (q^{n} + a_{n-1}q^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 q + a_0)\\
\notag
& \quad - a_0(qp-1).
\end{align}
Therefore $qp-1 \in I$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Algebraic Proof of (3)]
If $J$ has finite co-dimension, then $\FF\axs/J$ is a finite-dimensional ring,
and $[p][q] = [1]$.
The operation of left multiplication is therefore a bijection on the quotient
space: for each $r \in \FF\axs$, we have $[q][r] = 0$ implies that $[p][q][r] =
[r] = 0$, which shows injectivity.  It must be onto because it maps a finite
dimensional space into itself.  Therefore there exists some $s \in \FF\axs$ such
that $[q][s] = [1]$.  Therefore $[p][q][s] = [s] = [p]$, which shows $[s] =
[p]$, which shows $[q][p] = 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Matrix Proof of (3)]
I think a matrix proof essentially is the algebraic proof.
If $v$ is a vector, and $Qv = 0$, then $PQv = v = 0$.
Therefore $Q$ maps the space of vectors onto itself, and so given $w$ there
exists a $v$ such that$Qv = w$.  We see that $PQv = v = Pw$, so $QPw = w$.
Therefore $QP$ is the identity.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Idea}

Prove a Hilbert Basis Theorem like thing for the space $\{p(X) \mid X_k =
(x_{ijk})_{1 \leq i,j\leq N}\}$.
Is there something already like this?

\emph{Latest:} I notice that one can use dimensions to show there exist
polynomials which are $0$ on all $n \times n$ matrix tuples.

\subsubsection{Known Answers}

Let's look at the Hard NSS over just analytic polynomials.

\begin{exa}
In one variable, $\sqrt{I} = I$ for each two-sided ideal $I \subset \FF\ax$.
{\em Proof:} In one variable, $I$ is a principal ideal and furthermore has
finite codimension.  The result follows simply from here. \qed
\end{exa}

\begin{exa}
 Let $I \subset \FF\ax$ be the two-sided ideal generated by $x_1x_2 - 1$, in
two-variables.  Then $\sqrt{I}$ is generated by $x_1x_2 - 1$ and
$x_1x_2-x_2x_1$. {\em Proof:} If $X_1, X_2$ are matrices such that $X_1X_2 - 1
= 0$, then $X_1^{-1} = X_2$ and so $X_1, X_2$ commute, so $x_1x_2-x_2x_1 \in
\sqrt{I}$.  Further, $\sqrt{I}$ is contained in the two-sided ideal generated
by $x_1x_2 -1$ and $x_1x_2-x_2x_1$ since over $\CC$ we have $q(a) = 0$ where
$a_1a_2 - 1 =0$ iff $q$ is in the commutative ideal generated by $x_1x_2 - 1$.
\qed
\end{exa}

\begin{exa}
 If $I \subset \FF\ax$ is generated by $x_1x_2 - x_2x_1 + 1$, then $\sqrt{I} =
\FF\ax$. {\em Proof:} $x_1x_2 - x_2x_1 + 1$ always has positive trace, hence it
can never be $0$. \qed
\end{exa}



\subsection{Path Algebras}

I think that I can generalize some of my results to the case of path algebras.
(Specifically my Left Nullstellensatz and my Positivity stuff).

\subsection{Soft Zero Set}

Here is a question which, in part, relates to the positivity set of a linear
pencil.

\begin{question}
 Let $S \subset \FF\axs$ be a subset of $\FF\axs$.
 Compute the set
 \[
 \sqrt[\rm soft]{S}=
  \{ q \in \FF\axs \mid \det(q(X)) = 0 \mbox{ whenever } \det(p(X)) = 0 \mbox{
for each } p \in S \}.
 \]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
 Is there an easy result to be had if $S = \{p\}$?
\end{question}


\subsubsection{Known Results}

\begin{prop}
 If $p \in \sqrt[\rm soft]{S}$, then so is $qp$ and $pq$ for any $q \in
\FF\axs$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
 If $\det(p(X)) = 0$ then $\det(q(X)p(X)) = \det(q(X))\det(p(X)) =
\det(p(X)q(X)) = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
 Given $p \subset \FF\axs$, let $I = \FF\axs p$ be the left ideal generated by
$p$.  Then $\sqrt[\rm real]{I} \subset \sqrt[\rm soft]{\{p\}}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
 If $\det(p(X)) = 0$, then there exists some nonzero vector $v$ such that $p(X)v
= 0$.  By the Left Nullstellensatz, we also have $q(X)v = 0$ for each $q \in
\sqrt[\rm real]{I}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
 The set $\sqrt[\rm soft]{\{p\}}$ is almost never an ideal.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
 Will appear in two-sided paper.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
 If $p_1 \cdots p_k$ is in a soft zero set, so is $p_{\sigma(1)} \cdots
p_{\sigma(k)}$ for each permutation $\sigma \in S_k$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
 $\det(p_1(X) \cdots p_k(X)) = \det(p_1(X)) \cdots \det(p_k(X)) =
\det(p_{\sigma(1)}(X)\cdots p_{\sigma(k)}(X))$
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
 A soft zero set is real and $\ast$-closed.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
 Easy.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
 If $I = \sqrt[\rm real]{\FF\axs p}$ has finite co-dimension, then $\sqrt[\rm
soft]{\{p\}}$ is
\[
 \sqrt[\rm
soft]{\{p\}} = Z(I) + \bigcap_{q \in \FF\axs} I q
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
First, suppose $\theta \in Z(I)$, $\iota \in I$, and $s \in \FF\axs$.
Suppose $\det(p(X)) = 0$.  We can choose $X$ so that it is ``irreducible''. Then
there exists some nonzero vector $v$ such that $p(X)v = 0$.  By the Left
Nullstellensatz, $\theta(X)v = \iota(X)v = 0$.  ??Not hard to show that
$\theta(X) = 0$.??  Therefore $\det(\theta(X) + \iota(X)s(X)) =
\det(\iota(X))\det(s(X)) = 0$.

 Conversely, there exists pair $(X,v)$ such that $I = \cI(\{(X,v)\})$.  Further,
$\FF\langle X, X^* \rangle$ is semisimple, so $\FF\langle X, X^* \rangle \cong
\bigoplus_{i=1}^{N} M_{n_i}(D_i)$, where each $D_i$ is one of $\RR$, $\CC$, or
$\mathbb{H}$.  Further, we can pick $X$ so that $X = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n X^{(i)}$,
where each $X^{(i)}$ is a tuple of square matrices on a subspace isomorphic to
$D_i^{n_i}$, and $v = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n v_i$, where each $v_i$ is a nonzero
vector on a subspace isomorphic to $D_i^{n_i}$.

If $q \in \sqrt[\rm soft]{\{p\}}$, then $\det(q(X^{(i)})) = 0$ for each $i$
since $p(X^{(i)})v_i = 0$.  Therefore there exists some nonzero vector $w_i$
such that $q(X^{(i)})w_i = 0$.  Since $\FF\langle X, X^* \rangle \cong
\bigoplus_{i=1}^{N} M_{n_i}(D_i)$, there exists some $r \in \FF\axs$ such that
$r(X)$ is an invertible matrix which maps $v$ to $\bigoplus_{i=1}^n w_i$.
Therefore
\[q(X)r(X)v = \bigoplus_{i=1}^n q(X^{(i)})w_i = 0.\]
This implies that $\iota = qr \in I$.

Further, since $\FF\langle X, X^* \rangle \cong
\bigoplus_{i=1}^{N} M_{n_i}(D_i)$, there exists some $s \in \FF\axs$ such that
$s(X) = r(X)^{-1}$.  Therefore
\[
 q(X) - q(X)r(X)s(X) = 0,
\]
which implies that $\theta = q - qrs \in \cI_{\rm hard}(\{X\})$.  It is not hard
to show that $\cI_{\rm hard}(\{X\}) = Z(I)$.  Therefore
\[
 q = (q - qrs) + (qr)s = \theta + \iota s \in Z(I) + \bigcap_{q \in \FF\axs} I
q.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{exa}
 If $p = x^3$ and $I = \sqrt[\rm real]{\FF\axs x^3} = \FF\axs x^3$, then $Z(I)
= \{0\}$.  Note that $x \in \cI[\rm soft]{\{p\}}$ but $x \not\in Z(I) +
\bigcup_{q \in \FF\axs} Iq$.
\end{exa}

\subsubsection{Irreducible}

Suppose $p, q$ are both irreducible and distinct, and the setting is restricted
to just analytic polynomials.  In this case, probably $q \theta \not\in I_p$ for
any $\theta \not\in I_p$.  I need to look at when $q \theta \in I_p$.  Then,
one can leverage this, maybe, to find a ``flat'' ideal $J$ such that $q \theta
\not\in J$.

\subsubsection{Idea 2013.02.22}

If $I$ is a left ideal, what is the set
\[
 C(I) := \{q \mid Iq \subset I \}
\]
This set is a subring.  If $I = \FF\ax p$, and $p$ is irreducible, then I think
$C(I) = I$ is probably true.  If $I = \FF\axs x_1 x_2 x_1$, then $x_2 x_1 \in
C(I) \setminus I$.

If I can learn about this set, can I then leverage that to constructing a left
ideal with finite codimension such that $q \not\in C(I)$?

\subsubsection{Linear Pencils}

Could the linear pencil case be easier?

\subsection{Commuting Matrices}

What if we look only at the set of tuples of commuting matrices?

\subsubsection{Nullstellensatz for Commuting Matrices}

The answer might be $\sqrt{I} = I + {\rm Commutator\ Ideal}$.
Also note that this is a hard NSS.

\begin{proof}[Sketch of Proof]
 Let $p^k \in I$ but $p \not\in I$.  Let each
$X_i$ be
 \[
  X_i = a_i \begin{pmatrix}
             1&x_i&0&\cdots&0\\
             0&1&x_i&\cdots&0\\
             \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
             0&0&0&\cdots&x_i\\
             0&0&0&\cdots&1
            \end{pmatrix}
 \]
 The diagonal of $p(X)$ is $p(a)$ and the off diagonal is
 \[
  \sum_{i=1}^g a_i p_{x_i}(a) x_i
 \]
 Pick $a \in V(I)$ so that it kills $p$
 but not at least one of the $p_{x_i}(a)$. ??Why can one do this??
 Then there exists an $x$ which makes the off diagonal nonzero.
 One can show then that $p(X) \neq 0$ but $p(X)^k = 0$.
 ??There are a lot of details to fix on this sketch.  For example, this seems
to work well if $I$ is singly generated, but what about other cases? ??

Also note that the $X_i$ above kill the ideal generated by polynomials of the
form
\[
 (x_{i_1} - a_{i_1}) \cdots (x_{i_k} - a_{i_k})
\]
where $i_1, \ldots, i_k$ are some (possibly repeating) indices.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Positivstellensatz}

Don't know.

\subsection{New: Results On Other Fields}

It would be interesting to look at other fields (like $\ZZ/p$).
