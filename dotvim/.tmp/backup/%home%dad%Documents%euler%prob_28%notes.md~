It seems like one could write a closed form expression for the diagonal values.

For an $n \times n$ spiral, $n$ odd, the corners are $n^2, n^2 - (n-1), n^2 - 2(n-1), n^2 - 3(n-1)$.

We should have

3^2 + 5^2 + ... + k^2 =

(k+1) * (k+2) * k / 6 - 1

We also have

-6 * (2 + 4 + ... + (k-1))

which should be

$$
= -12 * (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)/2)
= -12 * (1/2) * (k-1)/2 * (k+1)/2
= -3 * (k-1) * (k+1) / 2
$$

For $k=5$, we should have
$$
-3 * (5-1) * (5+1) = 72
$$
I observe
$$
- (4 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 4 + 6)
= (24 + 12) = 36
$$
