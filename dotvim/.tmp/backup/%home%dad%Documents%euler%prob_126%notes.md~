Num cubes is
$$
ab + bc + ca
$$

We want to determine the number of solutions to
$$
n = ab+bc+ca
$$

**Idea**.
Maybe this is just an exhaust.
We will have exhausted when we have all $B \geq a,b,c$
for $n \leq 3B^2$.

**Adjustment**.

We then have to account for layering.

The first layer is
$$
ab+bc+ca
$$

The second layer is what?

In the $3 \times 2 \times 1$ example,
it is supposed to be $46$.

$$
2(3 \times 2 + 2 \times 1 + 1 \times 3)
+
4(3 + 2 + 1)
$$
This gives
$$
2(ab+bc+ca) + 4(a+b+c)
$$

The third layer?

**Help**.

Higher order of the form
$$
2(ab+bc+ca) + 4(a+b+c+n-2)(n-1)
$$

**Next.**
