The triangle in the middle is called the Cevian triangle.

It has area

$$
\frac{2abc}{(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)} \times A
$$
so that the ratio is
$$
\frac{(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)}{2abc} \; .
$$

We are looking for $(a,b,c)$ for which this is an integer.

# Observations

Scale everything by $x$.  The ratio remains unchanged.
We can assume that $(a,b,c)$ is coprime.

Let $p | a$ an odd prime.

Suppose $p$ does not divide $b$ or $c$.  Then it
must divide $b+c$.

On the other hand, suppose $p$ divides $b$.  Then $a+c$ and $b+c$ cannot
be divisible by $c$.  This fails to cancel out $p^2$ from the denominator.

Therefore we must have $a|(b+c), b|(a+c), c|(a+b)$.  (Up to an extra factor of $2$.)

Notice that
$$
k_a a = b+c
k_b b = a+c
k_c c = a+b
$$
gives
$$
k_a a + k_b b + k_c c = 2(a+b+c)
$$
