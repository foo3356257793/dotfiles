# How do we do this?

For $7$ the answer is $12$ or $15$

For $12$
$$
1*1*1*1*1*3*4 = 12
1+1+1+1+1+3+4 = 12
$$

For $8$,
check $12$

$$
1*1*1*1*1*2*2*3 = 12
1+1+1+1+1+2+2+3 = 12
$$

**reverse**.

If we have $12$, how many product sums can we form from it.

Here are the products
$$
12 = 2 * 2 * 3
$$
$$
12
2 \times 6
3 \times 4
2 \times 2 \times 3
$$

Here are sums we can make:
a single
$$
12
$$
doesn't work beyond the trivial $k=1$.

We have
$$
(1,1,1,1,2,6)
$$
$$
(1,1,1,1,1,3,4)
$$
$$
(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3)
$$

Here is an approach.

Hold an array for min product numbers up to $12000$.
Initialize to $0$.

Iterate over numbers.
Look at all factorizations and complete for minimal sums.
Look at the array and store at $0$ points.
Keep track of how many we have marked off.
If we mark off any, update sum.

## All factorizations?

How would one enumerate these?
