# Hardest problem?

Maybe the hardest problem in Project Euler.

# Ideas

Asymptotically, just depends on what the steps are.

A $x \mapsto 3x+1$ must be followed by an
$x \mapsto x/2$.

There are certainly edge cases, however.

Imagine a series of $x \mapsto (3x+1)/2 \mapsto \cdots$
followed by $x \mapsto x/2$.  Choose so that $(3/2)^i (2)^{-j} \approx 1$.
Then we have $x \mapsto cx + (1/2)(3/2)^{i-1}2^{-j} + (1/2)(3/2)^{i-2}2^{-j} + \cdots$.

This gives
$$
c(x + 1)
$$
If $c < 1$, we could ask when
$$
c(x+1) > x
$$
when
$$
c > \frac{x}{x+1} \; .
$$
We can imagine this happening.
