Girls' Camp is just over a week away!! We are looking forward to spending this time with you!

This Wednesday,
you are invited to drive by Sister Nelson's house between 7 and 8 PM,
where you will receive a
treat and a goodie bag from the Broadneck Ward Young
Women Presidency and Girls' Camp Directors.
Included will be a black t-shirt and directions and supplies to reverse tie-dye it.  This activity requires bleach; if you need bleach, please reply to this email and we will have some for you on Wednesday.

We are encouraged (but not required) to wear these shirts on specific days of camp.

**Note**: The Stake will be providing a separate camp kit that we will be delivering to your homes.  This is different from the goodie bag we are
handing out at this drive-by activity.

We are so blessed to have you, the Young Women, lead our Sunday discussions.  We have created a sign-up sheet that you can choose which date works best for you to lead a discussion.
The sign-up sheet will cover the rest of the year so please sign up for two slots in your respective group: middle school or high school.  

We are also blessed to have two wonderful advisors: Sister Bullough who will work with the Middle School group and Sister Fairbanks who works with the High School group. They are happy to offer you any support you may need.

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women! Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November 15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with
[this one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe
Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.

# June Birthdays

* Isabelle Weaver (11th)
* Mackenna Denyer (21st)
* Keren Millett (26th)
* Kezia Millett (26th)
* McKenzie Epps (26th)
