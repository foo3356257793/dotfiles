\subsection*{January 4, 2012}

I am travelling to Boston today to attend a math conference and to present a 30
minute talk on my work on the left nullstellensatz.

I am not excited about having to do this.  (1) I dread math conferences. (2) It
is lonely being away from my family; I have come to depend on them, and I love
them dearly. (3) Travel is hard, especially since I have been under the weather
the past couple of days; I am now sure that I have a sinus infection.

My dread in having to make this trip has really shifted my focus onto my family.

Before this vacation, I had been wondering about what could have been if my
talents in math had been better utilized.  As I saw it, I was born with great
gifts, yet I had been placed (or later on placed myself) in average/below
average educational environments.  I thought that if I had just had the right
advising, or if I hadn't had had certain negative influences in my childhood, I
could have done a lot more.  Going into this vacation, I was sorry that instead
of reaching for greatness and glory in the mathematics world I was reaching for
an easy yet unremarkable life as an actuary.

Over this vacation, especially early on, I have worked on math in intense
spurts.  The benefit of this was that I was able to prove the left
nullstellensatz; in my own small world view, this is a great result.  This
shifted how I view my time as a PhD student.

Up to that, I had solved one problem which took me approximately a month to
solve during my second year.  This result was good enough for a dissertation.  I
wasted a lot of time simply revising my work.  In addition I had solved a couple
of minor things which I was not going to publish and I had worked on the left
nullstellensatz paper.  As it was, the left nullstellensatz paper was to be
published even without my latest result.  Basically, I had scratched the surface
of the left nullstellensatz, and that was to be a paper.  Other than that, I saw
that I had a lot of time where I wasn't thinking about research.  Over the past
year, I had basically given up on research all together.  I viewed even my time
as a PhD student as me not truly maximizing my potential, and as such, I didn't
have great results to show for it.

During the time when I was originally working on the left nullstellensatz paper,
I viewed that problem as ``the big one''.  I felt that if I could just solve the
left nullstellensatz that I would somehow be validated.  In hindsight, I
probably had a false view of the importance of the problem, but it is still a
good result.  Still in my view, the left nullstellensatz is a much more
impressive result than what I previously have proven.   Therefore, in my inner
narrative, after having not done research for about a year, I took a week to
solve the biggest math problem of my life.

This experience really gave me a taste of life doing serious mathematical
research.  I got to experience what it was like to achieve solving a significant
(at least in my head) problem.  For that I felt like my talent was validated.  I
am smart enough to do math research.  On the other hand, I didn't feel
fulfilled.  My family is more important to me than wordly success.  As I worked
on my math problem, I took myself away from my family mentally.  No success
outside the home can make up for failure in the family.

\subsection*{January 6, 2012}

I spent the afternoon with my old mission companion, Elder Viriato.  I got to
spend time with his whole family, including 3 kids and his wife.  We went to a
Brazilian restaurant in my beloved Framingham, which was good.  I am glad to be
able to be friends with an old mission companion.

Also, I blew off the afternoon session of the conference.

I had more thoughts about my future career path.

To my surprise, I enjoyed the math conference.  I had results to share; I didn't
have to rely on my lame work on harmonic polynomials; it made me feel like I
belonged there; also, I enjoyed working out my results with my advisor's
collaborators; through explaining my results, I was stretched and even thought
of new angles for making my results even more polished.  It was a better taste
of how being a professor is.

This gave me some pause to think of whether I am making the correct choice to
pursue a career outside of academia.  I will say that I have not gone about
mathematical research in the right way.  First, I didn't read mathematical
papers, nor did I care much about them.  Second, I didn't seek out open problems
for me to work on; I could have been the master of the situation and picked
things that I wanted to do; in doing this, I would have needed to read up on the
field I was studying, going over papers to see what had been done and, if
necessary, how it had been done.  Third, I could have time blocked more
effectively.  As I see it, a big stumbling block was that I didn't give myself
enough help or outside ideas so that I was just figuring out everything for
myself.

Included in the things to do differently is talking to people.  I dislike
talking to people much more than I do reading mathematical papers.  I just
realize that it is important.

Therefore, through this conference I have caught a vision of what a career in
mathematical research could be, and I felt the excitement of making new
mathematical discoveries.  In a way it will be sad to give it up.

Why must I give it up.  I haven't forgotten all of the nights that I have been
in agony thinking about some math problem.  I haven't forgotten about all of the
lousy tasks that go with the joy of mathematical discovery.  I prefer to make
more money.  I prefer to work less hours so that I have more time with my
family.

\subsection*{February 9, 2012}

Today Allison and I completed a digital fast.  We decided for a whole day that
we would avoid our usual round of Internet and television consumption.  I found
the day to be invigorating.  I have been, for a while now, wanting to do
something about my out of control digital consumption, but I haven't been able
to commit myself to anything.  I hope that as a result of today that I will be
even more motivated to curb my digital diet.

\section{}

\subsection*{March 30, 2012}

For the past almost two weeks we have been in Utah seeing both of our families.
I appreciated the time I was able to spend with my mom and brother Craig, and
now we are on the second stint in St. George at Allison's family's home.  I love
how much everyone loves lil' Anna.  I am really enjoying raising Anna.

I have spent the past while in a stupor over gadgets.  Here is my story.

Over a month ago Allison and I performed a ``digital fast''.  We took the day to
essentially not comsume digital media.  I, in particular, was sick of being
addicted to digital media.  I loved it and wanted to cut back the next day too.
However things have devolved since then.

The first interesting event was that when Allison went to bed after our digital
fast, I decided to get things done.  In the midst of this, I carelessly broke my
laptop screen.  In light of the day's events, my reaction was to immediately
regret purchasing the laptop.  It turned out that I was able to buy a screen
replacement (for about \$100) and my brother Craig kindly did the work of
replacing the screen last week.  In the meantime, I brought out my old laptop --
nicknamed ``The Beast'', it has a broken hinge and can only be used if the
screen
is propped up against a wall -- and used it to complete my school work.  This
made me further regret my laptop purchase because the Beast worked for what I
needed, and further, I enjoyed using its larger keyboard to type out my
assignments.  I also note that if I were to take the SSD from my newer laptop
and put it in the Beast, the Beast would be even better.

The second thing that happened was that I got around to selling some stuff on
Craigslist.  I remembered that it is possible to sell things on eBay and
Craigslist and get money.  For example, I recently sold my convertible
netbook/tablet for almost what my mom paid for it.

The third thing is that I became aware that I am eligible for a phone upgrade.

The final thing that really tipped me over the edge was my tablet.  A few
different things happened with my tablet.

First, after about a week of owning my tablet, I installed an update from
Samsung to the tablet which made it, in my opinion, uglier and worse.  I tried
out a bunch of different custom roms to make the tablet better, but the only
ones that I really liked were the ones that were based on the newest version of
the Android operating system.  This came with some drawbacks: the camera doesn't
work; depending on the rom, the operating system can be unstable; there are apps
which simply don't work on the tablet; I haven't been able to change the font to
a font I like; I haven't been able to connect my tablet directly to my laptop.

Second, I sometimes pop by the UCSD bookstore to look at the Apple electronics.
I began to notice how the iPad did some things a lot better than my tablet.  The
web browsing exerience was night and day.  Apps are made for the iPad, whereas
on Android they are just stretched out phone apps; also, there are simply a lot
more apps -- like note taking apps or video apps -- which Android doesn't have.
The iPad has a beautiful Helvetica aethsetic.  This comparison was further
brought to light when I brought my tablet to my mom's and saw firsthand all of
these great points.

Third, I became somewhat addicted to certain games on my tablet.  Of course
these games are better on the tablet than on the phone.

Adding all this together, what happened is that in my mind I had a giant choice
presented to me as to whether or not I should sell all my gadgets and get new
ones or not.  More specifically, a line of reasoning presented itself.  I can
now see that the iPad is a better tablet than any Android tablet on the market.
Also, the iPad just had a refresh, which is the best time to buy an Apple device
(I can get the newest one at the normal price, or I can get the old one for less
than ever).  However, the biggest thing which would hinder my owning an iPad is
that one needs the iTunes music player in order to successfully set up an
``iDevice''.  For most people this is not a problem, however i use Linux, which
doen't have iTunes, and I do not want to use Windows.  Well, I have had
thoughts about selling my laptop anyway.  It then becomes feasible to buy a
Macbook.  In fact, there is a not so bad deal on a refurbished Macbook Air that
I would enjoy having.  Doing this wouldn't be too bad because (a) I can dual
boot to Linux and (b) I like certain parts of OS X, including the multitouch
gestures, stability of the operating system, and the increased availability of
apps.  So now, if I am on this route and I now own an Apple computer, there is
one phone which works best with Apple computers: the iPhone.  Certainly there
are things that I like about the iPhone: it is attractive, the metal casing
makes it feel premium compared to plastic Android phones, and it has the same
pleasing qualities the iPad has.  Sure, Android is cheaper, syncs better to
Google apps, which I use extensively, and lacks a built in GPS, lacks 4G, but
the one more thinks about it, the more one sees that one could get buy just fine
with one.  And then, while I am at it, Apple TV is only \$99 and allows any of
these Apple devices to stream to it wirelessly.

This is why Apple is the largest company right now.  Basically, with their
consumer lock-in strategy, I went from considering trading one of my gadgets to
get one of theirs to trading my three biggest gadgets to get three of theirs.
The total cost of this?  Estimating things out, I might spend \$1000 or more to
do this replacement.  That's crazy!  True, Apple products depreciate at a lower
rate than competing electronics, but \$1000 is a lot to spend considering I was
considering a low cost option of trading a tablet for a similarly-priced tablet.
 Especially crazy is that this started out with me doing a digital fast and
actually enjoying it.  Making this even more crazy is my preference for free and
open computing; I like not being tied down to one company (Apple), compelled by
my past spending to rely on their products and services; I like Linux.

This has led me to conclude that I need to get rid of my tablet.  I know this
will be disappointing to my wife, however there are two big reasons for this:
(1) the tablet only increases my time wasting and really I don't do anything
productive with it; (2) I went from being more than satisfied with my gadgets
when I had a laptop and a phone to being totally dissatisfied with all of my
gadgets -- the laptop and phone are the same, and I only added to what I have.

As a footnote, I probably will get a new phone, and it's going to be Android.

\subsection*{April 20, 2012}

\subsubsection*{Events}

My mom and Paul are in town to visit because it is Spring break for the kids.
So far we have gone out to eat some, Allison made a Sunday dinner, and my mom
has enjoyed taking care of Anna for us.

\subsubsection*{Problem}

I have had a rough time the past while.
I feel the way I feel after I have fasted and have needed to make a big change.

On a low level, I felt like it might be all related to the issue of which
phone I should get.  I felt like I should get an Android phone.  I got an
Android phone, one of the best ones on the market.  I still feel lousy.
So it could be something larger.  Or it could be that secretly I still wanted
to justify getting an iPhone instead. (The iPhone is ``more beautiful'', it has
the best selection of apps, and Apple keeps it up to date---i.e., it is cutting
edge all of the time without having to be tinkered with---and it has the best
camera; however, it doesn't have 4G, I'm more afraid of them breaking, and I am
invested in Google's cloud---which, by the way, is better than Apple's cloud.)

On a higher level, I felt like it could be my gadget addiction.  I have tried
harder to not idle around with my gadgets.  Still I feel lousy.


My next idea is that the thing I can do is to live better in every way I can:
go to bed and wake up early; eat healthily and regularly; exercise vigorously;
do better scripture studies; etc.

\subsubsection*{Night Thoughts}

Here is a list (for my own sake) to help me remember why I want an Android
phone instead of an iPhone:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Free turn-by-turn navigation.
 \item Gmail is better on Android (and I like Gmail).
 \item You can look at the file system.
 \item You don't have to use iTunes.
 \item More resistant towards drops.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{April 12, 2012}

I have had a rough while being distraught over my gadgets.
Today I decided to take back the Galaxy Nexus.
I decided to get instead the iPhone 4S.
I immediately knew that I needed to sell it.
Allison was also not pleased with my choice.
In hindsight, this might work out fine because I am pleased with my current
phone, so by selling the iPhone, I can make a profit, thereby capitalizing on
the subsidy which Verizon offers on the iPhone.

\subsubsection*{iPhone Experience}

I was mostly underwhelmed with the iPhone experience as I played with it
tonight.  Here is what stood out to me, both pro and con:


\begin{itemize}
 \item Google apps are lousy on the iPhone.  On the other hand, they are the
best thing about Android.  Gmail is the best mail service (in my opinion); on
iPhone the Gmail app doesn't have all the same features. Google Voice saves me
from having a texting plan; on iPhone, I found the Google Voice app to be
lacking.  Google Maps Navigation is the best free GPS app.
\item While Mobile Safari on the iPad is, from what I've seen, far superior to
tablet Android browsing, I found that on the iPhone I didn't like Safari as
well as Android's browser.  The main thing that bugged me was that for some
reason on iPhone one cannot scroll quickly.
\item The camera on the iPhone performed well.
\item Every app in the App Store works.  On my wonky devices, the same cannot
be said.
\item The glass and metal iPhone didn't necessarily feel any nicer than the
plastic phones I have been using.
\item I wouldn't feel comfortable using an iPhone without a home computer on
which iTunes was installed.  I have no such computer available.
\item As far as everything else, the iPhone was useable.  There are nice things
about it.
\end{itemize}

Given the cons of the iPhone, and given that my old phone ``just works'' when
it comes to my core needs (Making phone calls, Gmail, Google Voice, Music,
Internet, etc.), I believe that my old phone will continue to serve me well.

\subsubsection*{Galaxy Nexus Experience}

While I am at it, here are my pros and cons of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus

\begin{itemize}
 \item Phone service would drop from time to time.  This was an epic fail from
my perspective given that the primary responsibility of a smarphone is to be a
phone.
\item Apps worked on it.
\item It was light.
\item This goes for the iPhone too, but I felt uneasy carrying around such an
expensive gadget.  I always was afraid it would break.
\item The phone was super fast.  The 4G was super fast.
\item The camera was worse than my old phone.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{April 13, 2012}

I am probably going to sell the iPhone 4S I now own.  I went to Verizon
yesterday to reactivate my old HTC Droid Incredible.
Although I like things about the iPhone, I am underwhelmed with it, and in
contrast, I appreciate better the things my Droid does.
I think I am going to go low cost, low distraction as far as my gadgets go.  I
need to focus on other things in my life other than gadgets.

I listed it on Craigslist last night and didn't get any hits.  I will lower the
price on it.  I would settle for \$450 to \$500 for it.

\subsection*{April 15, 2012}

I am still in my phone dilemma.

It would have been easier if I didn't buy any new phone.
I would have spent no money, and I would have a simple, cheap phone which does
everything necessary for me.
I can still take back the iPhone, but then I won't be able to get a subsidized
new phone.  This might be a good option if I want to not have a smartphone once
my contract is up.

I now have the iPhone, and I basically \textit{have to} sell it.  Craigslist is
not panning out right now, and so I might have to do eBay.  I prefer not to do
eBay because (a) they take a cut of the sale and (b) I have to figure out
shipping on it.

The other option is to simply start using the iPhone.  I will say that as I
have dinked around with the iPhone as it has been sitting on my table for the
past few days, I have found the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item I have gotten used to Mobile Safari.  I figured out the trick to type in
an address or a search.  The reading mode option is right up my alley.  I am an
irrational fan of Helvetica, which iPhone uses, and on the other hand, Android
uses Droid Sans or now Roboto as its default sans-serif font.  All mobile sites
are optimized for the iPhone, whereas on Android some fail.  I also have become
more accepting that Mobile Safari doesn't do super fast scrolling because how
can one see everything on a page if one scrolls past it super fast.

\item I inadvertently plugged the iPhone into Ubuntu and much to my surprise
the iPhone's file folder opened.  In Ubuntu, I would be able to import my
pictures with no hassle.  I did not realize this was an option.  To do music,
however, one still needs iTunes.

\item I haven't changed my opinion of Google apps on the iPhone, but I have
softened my stance about how well I would be able to integrate Google with the
iPhone.

\item I noticed the iPhone won't let me run an app with sound and play music at
the same time.
\end{itemize}
Basically, I have found more and more reasons to convince myself to just use
the iPhone.  There is, however, an irrational force compelling me to stay with
Android: peer pressure.  (Actually, whether or not it is irrational is
debatable.)  Allison, despite having said that she would let me do what I want,
clearly likes Android better, and would love me to like Android better.  All of
Allison's family uses Android as well, which makes our ties to it even
stronger.  My brother Craig uses Android, and one of the things we can actually
bond over is using Android and hating Apple.  Finally, there is just something
uncool about liking Apple.  (For a certain subset of society, the opposite is
true---Apple is cool---but for the rest of us, Android is cooler.)  One
of the main reasons is that Apple is locked down and takes advantage of
things for their profit.  (They are a business, and the purpose of a
business is to make money, but still.)  Socially, I want to be squarely in
Android camp. In practice, when it comes down to picking a device and actually
using it, I am torn. I am disappointed with Android.  The Galaxy Nexus was cool
in some ways, but in a lot of ways it bugged me; every other new phone had
bloatware, out of date operating systems, and ugly custom skins slapped all over
them; my Android tablet has been a letdown; I am very uninspired by anything
Android.

Putting aside the social reasons, it is still somewhat of a tricky decision.
The social aspect makes it impossible.  I am planning on taking my old Android
and leaving the new iPhone to Utah for sure because I can't handle anyone
knowing that I have the iPhone now.

\subsection*{April 16, 2012}

I tried to be more productive today.  I ended up doing a lot of paper writing.
I have a paper I am working on by myself.  My professor asked me a couple weeks
ago a question about matrices of non-commutative polynomials.  I somewhat
quickly found out that I could extend my Left Nullstellensatz result to
matrices of polynomials.  I have been trying to write this up.  It is not a big
priority, and perhaps I ought not spend too much time on it, however, I do want
to finish it soon because I figure I won't be writing math papers for much
longer.

I have pondered somewhat more on the social aspects of the brands I use.
Here are some thoughts:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Above all, I need to seek the Spirit in my Android vs. iPhone decision.
I will note that I may need to go back to Android, which also happens to be the
socially acceptable decision.
\item Unfortunately, I have looked down on iPhone users over the time in which
I have been an Android user.  I did it even today.  I am glad that I am now
aware of it, but I ought not judge others over their brand usage.  (A case can
be made that brand usage correlates with personality characteristics, but
that's not something I need to read into.)  
\item I also have been biased over the past two years towards Android and have
not seen the benefits of iPhone. (After playing around with the iPhone, I see
the benefits of Android more clearly as well though.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{April 18, 2012}

I had a dream last night in which we were going to visit a pair of converts
from my mission in Brazil (Daiane and Liliane).  I really would like to find
out what has become of them.  I am impressed with the feeling that I was
treated well on my mission by them.  I am grateful for the opportunity I had to
serve a mission and to have been called to where I was called to.  There are
negative spins I can put on things about my mission (certain lousy companions,
my lack of social skills, getting in a car accident, etc.) but I was really
blessed by it.

\subsubsection*{Poetry}

I just had a thought about my last semester of Utah State.
I had a poetry class where I wrote poetry.
I had an odd point of view at Utah State.
Is that what brought out my weird poetry?
It almost makes me want to write about it;
the only thing is I mostly don't like poetry anymore
to want to write about it.
(I don't really connect with poetry;
I just liked my weird poems.)

Here are some of my poems:

\subsubsection*{The Sixth Sense}

\noindent I love technology.

\

\noindent See all the things you can do now:

\noindent Every day you can watch Law and Order reruns for hours;

\noindent Every day you can play hearts online.

\

\noindent Daybreak. When I check my

\noindent E-mail I see that the crocodile hunter died last night;

\noindent A candle in the wind‰ÛÓI would've liked to have known you*;

\noindent Dead at age 44.

\

\noindent People see me as I

\noindent Empty out garbage

\noindent Out in the street for mechanical

\noindent Pick up; as I walk across the

\noindent Lawn, up the steps, and

\noindent Enter the house, I wipe blades of grass off my bare feet.

\subsubsection*{Commentary}

I wrote this as an acrostic because I thought that was fun.
Half of the things here were sparked by memories of the summer of 2006;
I was home recovering from my broken leg.
The other half are from when I was at school that fall.

\subsection*{The Mathematician}

\noindent I have a one-centimeter-tall gremlin inside my head;

\noindent Reminds me of problems I have to solve;

\noindent Religiously chants numbers in my ear (4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42...)

\

\noindent As I write this poem,

\noindent I imagine some soft, pleasing background music; 5

\noindent I invite you, gentle reader, to do the same;

\noindent Music like ‰ÛÏCandle in the Wind (1997)‰Û? by Elton John;

\noindent I heard that song on the radio the other day‰ÛÓ

\noindent That's a really good song.

\

\noindent If you have to take a lower salary 10

\noindent To get a job with Internet access,

\noindent I suggest in the strongest possible terms you do it;

\

\noindent Where have you gone, O. J. Simpson?

\noindent What have you been doing?

\noindent I heard somewhere you sold your 15

\noindent Heisman trophy (1968) and took up golf;

\noindent Did you kill your wife?

\noindent Probably‰ÛÓwe all think so. \footnote[1]{O.J. confirmed our beliefs
recently with the announcement of his book \textit{If I Did
It.}}

\

\noindent I fell out of the top bunk today (7:00 am),

\noindent I tried to grab a pillow which had fallen 20

\noindent (My most comfortable pillow),

\noindent But in my dreamy state I overestimated my reach;

\noindent As I lay on the carpet looking upward,

\noindent I realized I had another pillow in my bed.

\

\noindent A random walk, 25

\noindent Sometimes called a ‰ÛÏdrunkard's walk‰Û?,

\noindent is a simple stochastic process,

\noindent Where one takes a step to the right with probability p,

\noindent Or a step to the left with probability 1 ‰öÕ p. \footnote[2]{$"$Random
Walk,$"$ Wikipedia.org, $<$http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random\_walk$>$}


\noindent Obla-Di, Obla-Da 30

\noindent What words do I most want to repeat in my life?

\noindent Happiness, Luck, Serenity, Silliness;

\noindent Except the gremlin inside my head eats words

\noindent And spits numbers.

\subsubsection*{Commentary}

This is basically a mashup of things that happened to me (falling out of my bed
at college), pop culture that ``hit me'' the right way (``Candle in the Wind'',
  O.J. Simpson, \textit{Lost}, ``Obla-Di, Obla-Da'', and a line from the
Brazilian song ``Palavras Repetidas''), and just random things (Internet at
your job, the mathematical concept of a random walk).

\subsection*{Think Weekend at Bernie's}

\noindent I tore open a pillow from his bed

\noindent And filled his chest with the insides‰ÛÓ

\noindent Feathers, straw, wood chips‰ÛÓ

\noindent To stop up the blood.

\noindent Merlin reentered the room with a girdle

\noindent Pulled it onto Arthur‰Ûªs wide torso

\noindent Squeezed as tightly as he could

\noindent Closing the wound.

\

\noindent I complained to Merlin that this wouldn't work.

\noindent I told him that people would find out what we had done.

\noindent I told him that people would eventually find out that dragons don't
really exist.

\noindent Merlin laughed: ‰ÛÏPeople will believe whatever we tell them, my boy!‰Û?

\

\noindent As Arthur's court poet,

\noindent I recently wrote about how the king had slain a mighty dragon

\noindent Which had come to Camelot to make trouble;

\noindent Arthur ran Excalibur through the dragon's throat and lungs,

\noindent Causing the vile beast to choke on his own smoke.

\

\noindent Merlin spread some strong-smelling potion over the undershirt

\noindent To cover the smell of blood and death.

\noindent I found some ladies‰Ûª powder

\noindent Applied it to his face to make it appear artificially white.

\noindent His limp body fit into the armor fairly easily.

\noindent We topped his head with a crown

\noindent And placed that famous sword at his side;

\noindent Arthur was ready to lead us into battle.

\

\noindent We could hear the party starting,

\noindent In commemoration of Arthur slaying the dragon:

\noindent Feet stomping,

\noindent A harp and lute playing softly,

\noindent Young squires bragging,

\noindent Young maidens gossiping;

\

\noindent When we came down the stairs with Arthur,

\noindent His arms extended over our shoulders,

\noindent The party stopped, stared,

\noindent Then bowed reverently to their king,

\noindent That mighty dragon slayer.

\noindent We couldn't help but smile.

\subsection*{Commentary}

This one is the last poem I could actually find.
It is the least personal, but as such, is the most understandable by regular
people.
I didn't really have anything to say here.
I put in things that sounded important (``People will believe whatever
we tell them, my boy!'')
How would I revise this if I had to do it today?
Would I give it more meaning?
Would I give it a sharper edge?

\subsection*{April 19, 2012}

I had a hard time getting motivated to do productive things.
It looks like I will go interview with the NSA to be a mathematician.

Allison asked me what I was going to do with the iPhone I have had for a week
and if I was going to keep it; I told her I didn't know; I don't really
understand what I was supposed to do; at first, I concluded I needed to go with
a new Android phone; after a gut-wrenching spiritual week, I concluded that I
was wrong; then when I bought the iPhone I felt to sell it; as I continued with
intentions to sell it, I felt good about keeping my old phone around, but I
felt uneasy about selling it on Craigslist or eBay; based on what was told to
me at Verizon, there wasn't much point in taking it back to them; the past
couple days I have felt neutral spiritually (which is normal for me).

Am I to conclude that I don't understand spiritual promptings as well as I
thought I did?  Or am I to understand that I was given promptings to try out
things that, although they weren't long-term solutions, were necessary for me
for my own knowledge and experience?  (I had at least one dating experience
which I felt was of this class.) (In terms of the phones, did I need to try out
a new, premium, but ultimately flawed Android phone to better appreciate an
iPhone?)  Or am I to conclude that through bad choices (i.e. buying the iPhone
and backing myself into a corner) I limited my options, so I now get different
spiritual promptings leading me to salvage my situation?

I don't really know right now what the answer is.

\subsection*{April 22, 2012}

I'm still having problems getting to a good place spiritually.

A huge problem for me is thoughts.  I get obsessed with unimportant (but
fun) things.  I dwell on topics for a long time.  Right now, the topic has been
the iPhone saga.  (This is not to mention that I have killed a lot of time by
playing games on my iPhone.)

The devil's advocate side of this (literally) is that my focus is also what
has allowed me to succeed in school.  I have attacked math problems with the
full force of my obsessive attention until I solved them.  I do recognize that
there is a time and a place for focusing on vocationally important problems;
however, balance is a valuable thing to have in one's life.

At church, we had a good topic for a lesson, following the promptings of the
Holy Ghost, which ties along with this.  How can I cultivate the Spirit in my
life if I am filling my thoughts with other things.  It doesn't matter that my
``other things'' are typically benign and good in moderation, in excess they
crowd out the most important things in my life.

Here is something I pulled up from scripture study about the Savior (Stephen
Robinson, \textit{Believing
Christ}, 115):

\begin{quote}
 Do not misunderstand me.  I am not suggesting here that Jesus in any way
indulged in unclean thoughts, for that would be sin, and he indulged in nothing
sinful.  I do not believe that he ‰Û÷struggled‰Ûª or ‰Û÷wrestled‰Ûª with temptations.
My only point is that he was as vulnerable to suggestions and impulses coming
into his mind from his mortal nature, a nature inherited from his mortal mother,
as any of us.  He simply paid no attention to those suggestions, and he
immediately put them out of his mind.  The ability of the flesh to suggest, to
entice, was the same for him as it is for us, but unlike the rest of us, he
never responded to it.  He didn‰Ûªt ponder, deliberate, or entertain the sinful
options even as theoretical possibilities--‰Û?he gave no heed unto them.‰Û?
\end{quote}

\subsection*{April 24, 2012}

I am having a really hard time staying on task today.
I have two conflicting desires.
The first is the pure desire to do what is right, useful, and productive.
The second is the desire to make myself feel good through entertainment,
devices, etc.
I know in my mind that I ought not give in to entertaining myself.
However, it seems hard to make the lifestyle switch to doing just that.

Yesterday I tried to keep my thoughts on important things and off of
unimportant things.  I did well at this for a while.  As the night wore on,
however, I realized that if I lived according to this one principle, I would
have to give up most of my entertainment.  As I see it, my daytime hours are
best spent on work.  My nighttime hours are best spent on family.  This leaves
no time for alone time.

Another way of looking at this is that I am addicted to procrastinating,
entertainment, technology, etc.  Time spent feeding that addiction is bad for
me right now.  Yet, because I am addicted, I don't know how to stop.

\subsection*{April 25, 2012}

I didn't have a very productive day.
As a result, I felt lousy.

I was glad to finish my math homework (which is due next week).
In class today, we were told that we would be responsible for presenting a
problem from the homework.  I was assigned to the only problem which I had not
completed.  I was able to find a hint on the Internet (not a solution, just a
hint) and with that I completed the assignment.

I still am having dark feelings now that the iPhone is reactivated.  I am
strongly considering returning it, getting out of my smartphone plan in a few
months, and then going to a ``dumbphone''.
I realize that my time and energy at home is best spent with my family and not
spent on playing with my gadgets.

\subsection*{April 26, 2012}

From my scripture study (``Beware of Pride''):
\begin{quote}
 Our will in competition to God‰Ûªs will allows desires, appetites, and passions
to go unbridled. (See Alma 38:12; 3 Ne. 12:30.)...The proud wish God would agree
with them. They aren‰Ûªt interested in changing their opinions to agree with
God‰Ûªs.
\end{quote}
I have had a problem letting certain desires, appetites, and passions go
unbridled.  Further, I have been somewhat unwilling to agree with God on my
phone situation; instead, I have wanted God to agree with me.

\subsection*{April 27, 2012}

I have had a spiritual attack again.
My stomach is once again in knots.
It started when I reactivated the iPhone.
I need to deactivate it and switch back to what I had.

\subsection*{April 28, 2012}

I woke up today still with a bad stomach.
I am wondering if I simply have stomach problems.
I spent the day trying to soothe my stomach.
Milk helped.  Pesto Bismol didn't.
I have tried a lot of different permutations of phone choice, and I haven't
found anything that really let me get back to normal; maybe it's not the phone.

\section{}

\subsection*{May 1, 2012}

I am going to have to break it to my brother Craig that I now have an iPhone.
I think he is going to be upset about it because he is hardcore anti-Apple.
I am trying to think of what to say to him:

\subsubsection*{Problems with Android}

The biggest problem with Android for me is lack of support.
I'll break it down into a few cases.

\subsubsection*{Most Android Phones}

The large majority of Android phones don't get regular updates.
I would be especially skeptical of owning one that was a year old or older
because I don't think it would get more updates.
Also they have skins over the software which I hate.
They are ugly and make the phone slower.

\subsubsection*{Nexus Phones}

In theory the solution to this problem is the Nexus line.
I bought a Nexus phone.
It had bad reception; the Internet thought this was a software problem, but
Verizon wasn't authorizing updates to it yet.  It also had relatively bad
battery life (because it was 4G) and a subpar camera.
Also, instead of just being able to open it like a USB device
(which was nice for me)
it had a funky protocol which made file transfers slower; also, it didn't work
well on Linux so I ended up having to use Windows to transfer files.

\subsubsection*{Custom Roms}

So in theory the solution to this is rooting and installing a custom rom.
I do prefer this method to using the stock software on the phone, but it has
its downsides.
I have to wipe my phone and manually install the updates and hope it doesn't
brick my phone.
Further, depending on the phone, the developer community may not have all the
available drivers, so I may not be able to get that great of a rom.

\subsubsection*{Android Is Closed}

In theory the iPhone is ``closed'' and Android is open.
But as a comparison, I can get timely updates for my laptop on Linux (which is
open), but I can't get (important) updates on Android in a timely manner because
it is controlled by the hardware manufacturer and the wireless provider.
Further, on Linux I can install any kind of crazy distro I want whereas on
Android I have to stick with stock or with what the developer community was
able to come up with based on availability of drivers.

\subsubsection*{The Trade-off}

So Android is supposed to be great because it is more open, hence more
customizable, and is better on the price to harware quality ratio.
Do these still hold for me?

First, I think that Android is closed too.
As far as customizing my phone, after using Android for almost two years, my
workflow naturally has gravitated towards just using the stock settings and
focusing on a grid of icons.
For this iPhone is actually better because it only has a grid of icons instead
of a more complex two-layered approach of a home screen and app drawer.

Second, with a contract, the newest iPhone is \$200.  Top of the line
Android phones are \$300. The iPhone has great all-around hardware (including
perhaps the best camera on a phone).  The iPhone is actually a pretty good deal
financially for what you get.  Also, it is worth noting that in the used market
iPhones hold their value better than Android phones and are easier to sell.

What else is better about iPhone?

People generally make apps for iPhone before Android.
Virtually any app in the App Store will work on a new iPhone because there are
literally only a few iPhones and they all run the same exact OS.  Often,
if an app is on both iPhone and Android, it is better on iPhone (for example,
every app from the Church). On Android, an app may not be supported on every
device; if an app is only supported on a select number of devices, then you
pretty much can count on never having support for that app.

Mobile Safari is also a more plesant experience than the Android Browser.
Pinch to zoom is better.
Tap to zoom works better.
I like the features it has.
Also, websites tend to do a better job at building mobile versions of their
site for iPhone than for Android.

I also reiterate the support issue.
It is nicer knowing that your phone will work, will get bug fixes, and will run
the latest version of the OS.

I will mention there are things that are better about Android still, but I
in a lot of cases I don't care or I actually prefer the iPhone alternative.

\subsection*{May 13, 2012}

I screwed up Mother's Day.
I failed to plan anything special.
I had to spend all day trying to fix it.

\subsection*{May 17, 2012}

We had been planning on visiting Allison's family
this week.
Last night, I felt stress because I knew that by doing this trip,
I would lose a few days of working.
Seeing that there are only a few weeks left of school before I graduate,
this seemed like too hard to handle.
I therefore came to the difficult decision to stay home while
Allison travelled.
I will miss her and Anna so much.
I really love the family I have here.

\subsection*{May 18, 2012}

It was mostly an uneventful day.
I got some work done.
I also did a lot of procrastinating.
Hopefully I will do better tomorrow.

\subsection*{May 19, 2012}

I slept in really late, did some work,
and then watched TV.

\subsection*{May 20, 2012}

I went to Stake Conference today.
Here are some thoughts.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Listening to everything really motivated me to improve my scripture
study.
\item I got an invitation in my email to sing in the stake choir a couple of
days ago, but I didn't reply to it because I didn't want to sing because I
don't like singing in choirs.
\item I missed my family.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{May 21, 2012}

I did math today.

\subsection*{May 29, 2012}

I have had a stressful past few days.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item First, the NSA sent me an email a couple weeks ago saying that they were
sending me a packet with informations and some envelopes to mail back some
forms.  I didn't get the packet so over the weekend I was frazzled that we
weren't receiving mail (there were other examples of things we didn't get.)  I
finally got the packet today, however, and I sent everything off.
\item I have also been in a dilemma about graduation.
My professor suggested not turning in my final forms so that I wouldn't
graduate until summer.  Therefore, I would be able to work for him in the
summer, which would be convenient seeing how I don't have a job lined up.
Long story short, it is scary both ways, especially since I am already in a
rush to get my defense done.
\item I still have to find a job and possibly move soon.
These are big things.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{May 30, 2012}

I changed my mind about graduating in the summer, and am now thinking about
graduating this quarter as originally planned.
I just need to find a job.

\section{}

\subsection*{June 1, 2012}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item I am still wondering about whether or not we will move right away.  As
it is now, signs point to yes, however, I feel like it is a no.
\item I have been considering giving up sports fandom for a while.  The main
thing that brings me back to it is that it is a common interest between me and
so many people, so it makes it easier for me to make conversation with people
who like sports if I also like sports.  The main thing that makes me question
my sports fandom is the absurdity of it.  What is the point for cheering on one
group of people who I don't know over another group of people in a contest that
has no tangible effect on my life?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{June 8, 2012}

I had my thesis defense today.  It went really well.
Everyone seemed to enjoy my talk.
I am now officially shooting for summer graduation.
I am also not going to walk in graduation.
I was also appreciative of Allison for her coming, taking pictures, and just
generally supporting me.

\subsubsection*{NSA Forms}

I received an email from the NSA a few days ago requesting more information for
my security forms.  The bulk of my work was to contact tons of people to get
them to give me their contact information so that I could list them as a
reference.  It was a pain.

\subsection*{June 9, 2012}

I had a day mostly free from working.
I spent a lot of time with Anna.
In the afternoon the whole family went out shopping.

I am pondering about two topics: (1) sports fandom and (2) brand loyalty.  Both
are phenomena where one decides to root for something which tangibly has no
connection to one's interests.  With my gadgets, I am getting past it (to a
point) by having switched my brand loyalty; this in addition to knowing that
what brand of gadgets one uses is not worth worrying about much.

\subsection*{June 15, 2012}

I had a few thoughts over the past couple days.

I read an article on a blog I read describing a star researcher who has had
success by mastering techniques.  One of the things that has been
limiting in my academic career---although, depending on my future career
choices, this could be a moot point---has been that I don't read mathematical
papers.  I seem to rely on my limited store of knowledge to solve the limited
set of research problems of which I am aware.
In another life, I would change this habit and regularly read papers, learn
techniques, and in general build my store of mathematical knowledge.

Lately I have been spending a lot of time on research.  I have done the
following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Worked a lot on the so-called Lance-Tapper conjecture.  I proved it in
at least one special case.
\item Worked on a problem my advisor put forth to me.  I have come up with some
results, but there is still more work to be done.
\item Worked on a paper we are putting together on real ideals based on some
work I have done.
\end{itemize}

In the meantime, here are things I haven't done which I should be doing:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Put out more resumes.
 \item Worked on getting a version of my dissertation published.
\end{itemize}

Of my job prospects, given my current enjoyment of mathematics, I have
been more excited about those opportunities which are more mathematical
(specifically the NSA).  I got a call from FICO about a consultant position,
and I was a little bit unexcited about it because it would be a transition
away from the work I have been doing (lately) towards a more social and
statistical realm.  This leads me to wonder if I want a postdoc in the future.
The problem with that is that I couldn't get a postdoc for another year, plus it
is a bump down in salary.

\subsection*{June 22, 2012}

My mom and Paul came into town on Sunday and stayed until early this morning.
It was nice to have my mom in town.
I really appreciate all the support she has given me over the years.

\subsubsection*{Randoms}

I had a thought about combinatorics.
Combinatorics is a field of mathematics which is very popular at UCSD.
I was thinking about it the other day and thought to myself that I might have
done well at it and enjoyed it.

\subsubsection*{Job Search}

I have been offered on-site interviews with FICO in San Rafael, CA and with
the NSA in Ft. Meade, MD.  My interview with FICO is next week whereas my
interview with the NSA is in a month.

I feel like the NSA job will be more interesting and that it will take care of
me.  I am going into the FICO job, however, willing to hear them out and see if
the money will be better with them.  I just hope that I don't have to make a
quick decision between the two but that I can have both of them play out.  I am
confident however that the Spirit will be with me throughout all of it.

\subsection*{June 26, 2012}

I had my interview with FICO postponed until next week.
This is a relief since I now have more time to prepare,
and I also like it because the interview will now be spaced closer
to my scheduled interview with the NSA.

I have been working a lot on mathematical research lately.
I don't know if this is prudent, but it just is.  Somehow,
I now have a lot of results floating in the air which could potentially be
written up as papers.

\subsection*{July 7, 2012}

Let me cover various topics from the past couple weeks.

\subsubsection*{FICO}

I flew out to San Rafael, California, on Tuesday (July 3, 2012) to interview
for a consultant position.  My feeling going into and coming out of the
experience was apprehension.  I still went and did it on the basis of wanting
interview experience.

As for the interview itself, I did not really feel that the position was a good
fit for me.  The position called for a lot of talking to clients about
projects, and it was different from the research background I am used to.
Also, I am not a statistics person, yet this position called for a lot of
statistics.  Finally, the position called for leadership on projects, and I am
just starting out.

Ultimately, however, they called back on Friday to say that I did not get the
job.  The comment I received was that they went with someone with more
optimization experience.
I will say that I am relieved for a couple reasons.  First, I wanted the NSA
job more; I likely would have turned down the position if I did get it.
Second, which is a larger issue, is that I am refocusing my interests on
mathematics itself.

\subsubsection*{Mathematics}

I have spent the last months working on
mathematical research problems.  I have somehow found a renewed joy of
mathematics.  I am digging in deep into writing up some results that I have.  I
am frantically trying to solve a couple more problems (the Lance-Tapper
conjecture principal of those).  In this rush, I started to realize some things.
Especially after submitting my NC harmonics paper for publication (it was
accepted, incidentally),
I realize that I can write papers with results I publish.
I realized that one can site others' results in papers.
I realized that I can read mathematical papers in order to find out more about
topics I am researching and to look for potential techniques I can use. (And I
have read through more papers in the past week than I had the past year or two
combined.)  Basically, I am all of the sudden figuring out how to be a proper
mathematician.

Here is the problem: I figured it all out \textit{after} I finished graduate
school.  I am rounding into a proper mathematician too late.
I have been going forward with my plan to get a job
outside of academia.  I felt a spiritual confirmation of said plan.  I'm down to
one job prospect where being a mathematician and working outside of academia are
feasible, the NSA position.  The logical part of me wonders whether or not I
would be better off with a postdoc.  I chose to have a family, however, and as
such I need a job now instead of next year when I could possibly get a postdoc.

In hindsight, I like my life as it is.
I feel like if I could just be strict about keeping a schedule of when I study
and when I don't think about math, I could have a well-balanced life doing math
and raising a family.

\subsubsection*{Talking to People}

So tonight it came to a point where Allison confronted me about my not being
friendly with people.  Frankly, I gave up on being friendly with people a long
time ago.  In most social situations, I simply don't try to make friends.  I
realized in talking to her the extent of how much this hurts her.  I need to
do better.  Honestly, however, the first major hurdle is wanting to do better.
Sincerely, I like not having to talk to people.  It suits me.

\subsection*{July 14, 2012}

I have an interesting life dilemma.

Over the past while I have been obsessed with doing mathematics.
I solved a problem which my advisor posed to me, and I am feverishly trying to
write it up.
I also might have solved an open conjecture; I need to go through things more
closely to see; in my possible solution, I actually solve a stronger problem
which is a hard Nullstellensatz for NC polynomials.
All of the sudden, my mathematics portfolio is blossoming.  I am finding a
passion for mathematics that I didn't have before.

On the other hand, I am surrounded by people in my life who don't feel the same
way about mathematics as I do and hence are not as understanding of my newly
found obsession for mathematics.  I keep feeling like I just don't have enough
time to do math with all of the demands on my attention from my family.  It
sounds ridiculous to put math over my family, and it is ridiculous.

I now have to (still) find a job.
I rejected academia.  Did I make the wrong choice?
Now that I have found some self-confidence and success with my mathematics, I
am at the end of my academic career, and I won't get to build on it.

\subsection*{July 27, 2012}

\subsubsection*{NSA Interview}

On Sunday July 22 I flew to Maryland for my interview with the NSA.
I stayed in a Courtyard Marriott during the course of my stay.

On the first day I had a polygraph test.  It was horrible.
For some reason, I became uncomfortable during the latter part of the
examination and I started failing the test.  The examiner took a very hostile
turn towards me and accused me of lying to him, of having committed some
serious crimes.  I did not take it well.  They offered to schedule a do-over
for Thursday of this week.  I accepted the do-over, and as such I had to stay
in Maryland for an additional day.

The second day was an interview with the mathematics group at the NSA.
I got to go on the main NSA campus, which was cool.  The mathematicians I
interviewed with were nice (including that the first person I interviewed with
was a member of the church, which put me at ease).  I gave a talk, as planned,
and I felt that it went well, although it's hard to gauge how well my talks
ever go.  It was a more positive experience than before.

The third day was a psychological interview.  It was fine.

The last day was my do-over on the polygraph.  I eventually passed it as I was
able to be more calm and have more conviction in my answers.  Still, I found
the polygraph process to be aggravating.

\subsubsection*{Keith}

My brother Keith is stationed at the NSA.  We have not been close ever since he
became an angry person during our adolescence.  My mom made me email him so that
we could do something during my stay.  He ended up wanting to do stuff every
night until bedtime.  I was grateful for the opportunity to reach out to him.  I
let him talk about a lot of things that he is personally interested in, and I
felt a lot of positive energy from that experience.  I also felt for him because
it seemed like he doesn't have a lot of people he hangs out with because he was
very eager to hang out with me every day.  I am grateful that, if nothing else,
to have been pushed into spending time with him.

\subsubsection*{Pondering My Future}

I don't know what to think about my future career.

The NSA position has a lot of good points to it.
I would be making about as much money as I could reasonably expect to make out
of college (nearly \$90,000 be year, plus great benefits, plus other moneysaving
perks).  I would be forced to spend exactly 40 hours a week on my work, which is
positive for my family and church life.
I would be doing mathematics---other jobs I have looked at haven't had the
title mathematician, and I have become increasingly pessimistic about such jobs.
 These are three great qualities.

What is wrong with that then?  

First, I am being presumptuous to assume that I would even get the job at this
point; I felt good about my interviews, but I don't know if I passed; I don't
know how I compare to the other mathematicians who are applying; I don't know
how hard it is to pass a background check.

Second, I don't have the clear spiritual feeling about it that I had when I
made other life decisions---for example, going to UCSD, getting married, etc.  I
have actually been feeling a little lousy.  This is confusing because I did have
a clear feeling about not becoming a professor; I had a clear feeling about not
becoming a quant; I thought I had a good feeling about becoming an actuary, but
I have given it up after (a) getting a clear feeling to not go to an interview
for an actuarial internship and (b) seeing how hard it was to get looked at for
entry-level actuarial positions as an over-qualified Ph.D.  Also, I feel good
about mathematics now.  I have had some good successes these past few months.  I
don't necessarily think that that implies that I ought to pursue academia.  I
do, however, want to follow the spirit and figure out what is right for our
family.

Finally, the big tradeoff is that I have to become super-secretive about my
professional life.  I can't bring gadgets to work or (probably) email home
during the day.  I won't have the flexibility to work from home.  I have to go
through the government to travel outside of the country or make foreign friends.
 It feels like I am selling out my freedom. 

As of now, I am really confused as to what I should do.  I want to take care of
my family, and the paycheck would make things much easier for me on that front,
yet ultimately I need to do what the spirit dictates.

\subsection*{June 28, 2012}

Today was Saturday.
I have had a lousy feeling about the NSA position, hence I have been thinking
more and more about going for a position in academia (starting with a postdoc
likely).  As such, I then became franctically fixated on coming up with a
mathematical result.  Today I wanted to prove a powerful non-commutative
nullstellensatz, and I ended up working most of the day on that.
I think this was bad for me, and I think that I need to stop working at home so
much.

\section{}

\section{}

\subsection*{August 6, 2012}

I am trying to be better.

\subsection*{August 10, 2012}

Today I got the news that I passed the preliminary meeting of the
NSA mathematics hiring committee.  If I am approved on my security check and by
the second committee, I will get a job offer.
This has got me thinking about my future.

First of all, I can't really justify a way I don't take the job if offered it
given my family's needs.  Allison especially has been putting a lot of pressure
on me to be applying for more jobs (I haven't in a long time).  Given that the
NSA position pays so well (almost \$90 K per year), it would solve all of my
financial problems.

Next, I have been complusively trying to get my research done.
I have lots of material that I am just trying to get typed up so that I can
ship it out.  Most of it will futurely be published in journals I hope.  I
have, to date, had two of my papers now accepted for publication, and another
one has now been submitted.  I have enjoyed being able to get so many
mathematical results.

Therefore, what about that career in academia?
I think I could do it.
However, where would the money come from?
Also, I have had a hard time meeting the demands of my work and meeting the
demands of my family.  It has really been tearing me apart.

\subsection*{August 12, 2012}

I will reflect on my life in this post.

\subsubsection*{I Am Inherently Lazy}

I have thought about and felt guilty about various aspects of this during this
past week.  In a lot of what I do, I take the path of least resistance.  I
specifically feel guilty about shirking my church responsibilities and about not
being a good roommate/person to live with because I don't do housework.

How have I gotten by while being so lazy?  I have a few ideas.

First, I was
blessed in this life to have a talent for schoolwork.  I have no concept of how
hard people have to work in school.  Today I was thinking about a couple of
past experiences.

One was a psychology class I took my first year of college.
I took it seriously, so I new I needed to read the assigned textbook chapters.
As far as I can remember, all I did to study for the test was read the chapters
once through, and then review them shortly before the exams.  As we had exams,
I aced them.  By contrast, many people in the class for some reason felt that
the exams were difficult (including an old friend from high school who was an
honors student.) A related experience to this was getting the highest grades in
the class in my history of opera class because I had the best memory in the
class.

A final example to share is my first year of graduate school.  My
method of study for the most part was to do my homework, do some review before
the exams, and nothing else.  My topology teacher decided we needed to do some
work together, so he had us present our solutions to problems.  On many
occasions I was the only one to come up with solutions to specific problems,
and I always solved every problem.  Before that, I had no idea I was doing so
much better at the homework than everyone else. (If I remember correctly, I
wasn't actually scoring that well due to tough grading and due to my writing up
of the answers.)  I also recall comments from people in my program about how
difficult the first year was, even though I didn't feel like it was that
difficult.

My point is, I have been allowed to complete school---that is, the most
important vocational activity in my life---with relative ease.  As a byproduct,
I haven't been forced to struggle to succeed at much in life, hence I can be
lazy.

My second point, however, is that sometimes I am not lazy.  If I get excited
about something, I put in work to do well at it.  For example, in my math
research, I have had breakthroughs after intensely working on problems.
In my first-year graduate-school courses, I mentioned that I did my homework
and not much else; what I should note is that my homework was intense and that
I put in the focused effort to do it because I was excited about it. (It was so
hard, as I mentioned, most people did not complete all of it.)  Letting my
excitement spur on an intense focus in me has been a successful strategy for
succeeding at school.  On the other hand, I can name things I am not excited
about: cleaning the apartment, talking to people in my callings at church,
waking up early, etc.  It also might come back to haunt me with my job search
(I am basically banking on getting a position with the NSA at this point.)

How can I overcome laziness?

\subsection*{August 15, 2012}

I am spending my working hours revising mathematical papers.
Today I spent a lot of time on a postivstellensatz paper
I have had in the works for a couple months.

\subsection*{August 23, 2012}

I am still working a lot on mathematical papers.
One bit of progress is that it looks like I will be a part of a two-sided
nullstellensatz paper with the same professors who were on the left
nullstellensatz paper.  Also, a left nullstellensatz examples paper was
recently completed and posted to Arxiv.  It will soon be submitted for
publication as well.  I also don't remember if I posted news about this, but my
NC harmonics paper was accepted for publication in Integral Equations and
Operator Theory, and the left nullstellensatz paper was accepted for
publication in the Proceedings of the London Mathematicial Society.
Finally, my positivstellensatz paper is rounding into shape.  I got some good
results the past couple of days.  All in all, that makes five potential papers,
which is pretty good I think.

\subsection*{August 28, 2012}

I woke at 6:30 this morning.
I was inspired by the blessings I have received as a member of the church for
living a clean lifestyle, and I wanted to take it to the next level to get even
more blessings.

\subsection*{September 13, 2012}

We are in Utah for the next few days.
We are visiting both families, and will be spending tomorrow
with my mom for Anna's first birthday.
(We have already been here for a few days already.)

The NSA got back to me and said that I have been approved for work
subject to budget constraints.
I will find out more in October.
This is frustrating because I want to have the job search taken care of already.
I am trying to follow the spirit and do what is right.

\subsubsection*{My Mathematics Education}

I have had occasion to think about my past mathematics education.
Jonan is taking Algebra 1 as a $7^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grader,
and I have had to help him complete his homework each day.
He has had a lot of trouble doing his work correctly.

In contrast, when I was in $7^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade, I had to take
Pre-Algebra.  In $6^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade, my teacher had us work
independently through our mathematics curriculum.  I got through a sizable
chunk of the book by myself over the first part of the year.  Then for some
reason I never did much with mathematics for the rest of the year (see below
for a guess). We were given placement test for mathematics at the end of the
year and I placed into Pre-Algebra.  I remember not having been exposed to
algebra, and hence getting a lot of the algebra questions wrong.

In $7^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade, I had my worst year academically.  I was also
going through my parents' divorce in $6^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ and $7^{\mbox{\tiny
th}}$ grade, so I had a hard time.  My last semester I pulled horrible grades.
However, during this time, we started covering some simple algebra in my math
class.  I was in a ``gifted'' program, so everyone in my class was advanced,
however I started noticing that where others were having a hard time getting
some of the material, I found it to be easy.  I remember being able to do
algebra problems very quickly in my head while others had to sit down and work
it out.  I latched onto mathematics at that point.  I started doing extra
credit mathematics assignments---it was the only thing I liked to do.  My
$7^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade year I must have pulled all C's and D's except for
an A in Pre-Algebra and a B-something in gym.

In $8^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade we moved to Utah and my mom managed to get me
placed into Geometry, in effect skipping Algebra 1.  I dominated that class as
well, which boosted my self-confidence.  I remember, however, my teacher doing
a few things which irk me as I look back on them.  One was separating me from
working with the brighter students in the class, instead urging me to help the
slower students in the class; I believe this was
harmful to my development and has contributed to my difficulties in talking
about mathematics with fellow students in graduate school.
There are other things that annoyed me as well.

In $9^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade I had a good mathematics teacher.
I also placed in the top 50 for $9^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ graders in the Utah State
Mathematics Competition.  I don't remember ``dominating'' the class, although I
felt I did well.

In $10^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade, I really started to dominate my classes again.
I remember scoring perfect scores on virtually every exam.
I also remember that I finished reading our textbook halfway through the year
and started studying calculus independently.
I also remember an episode where my misguided guidance counselor told me
calculus would be too hard for me and that I ought not take calculus.

In $11^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade, I really dominated my calculus class.  We
would take lots of days where we would not learn new material but would work on
our homework.  I would have nothing to do in these days but study other
subjects because I could finish my homework quickly the first day I got it.
I passed the Calculus AB test with a 5, which is the top grade.

My $12^{\mbox{\tiny th}}$ grade class was a missed opportunity for me because I
took ``independent study'' Calculus BC and Statistics.  In hindsight, I would
have been better served by taking college mathematics that year.  I passed the
Calculus BC test with a 5 (easily) as well as the AP Statistics test.  I had
gotten to the point where I realized I new more than my teachers about
mathematics.

\subsection*{September 16, 2012}

We drove to St. George yesterday.  We arrived safely.

Today, unfortunately, I realized that I had no church pants.
I think what happened was that I packed them on the Saturday before we left
for Utah, but on the next day, Sunday, I unpacked them to go to church.  Oh
well.

\subsubsection*{Sports Addiction}

I pondered on my addiction to following sports.
I read an article by someone who quit following sports.
Here are some thoughts.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The thing I hate about it is having an emotional investment in the
outcome of something to which I have no tangible connection.
\item The other thing which I don't like about it is the time I waste on it.
\item The positive is that it is the great equalizer---I can talk to most any
guy about sports.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{October 1, 2012}

My advisor Dr. Helton got me a teaching visitor position at the university.
This quarter I will be teaching Math 20B.  I am getting paid about what I was
getting for being a TA.

\subsection*{October 7, 2012}

We had general conference this weekend.
My faith really grew and I have a great desire to improve.

My teaching is going well.

I am still waiting to see what my job and housing situation will be.

Anna is walking now and she is a delight to have in our home.

I love my wife Allison and am really grateful for her.

I want to record my testimony of the gospel.
I know that tht \textit{Book of Mormon} is true.
It is from God.  It has the power to change lives.
I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet and that he saw
God, the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ.
I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is the church of
God on the earth today.  In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

\subsection*{October 8, 2012}

I know that I do better when I do all of the standard daily items:
wake early, exercise, eat breakfast, morning scripture study, and write in my
journal.  I need to get back to that.

I had a teaching day today.
In some sense it went poorly because I failed to teach the material well.
I have a missionary attitude when it comes to teaching, however, and I hope to
resolve any doubts about today's material in my next lecture.

\subsection*{October 11, 2012}

I have been working a lot on my midterm coming up.  I wrote two practice
midterms and one actual midterm.  I have been obsessing over getting the
details just right.  I even spent the extra time to get the design of the exams
to be the same as the design of the course website---lots of Helvetica, light
blue MATH 20B in large, bold, capital letters as the title, margins at 66 ex.
I probably didn't record this, but I also spent an inordinate amount of time
polishing my course web page before the course started.  I easily could have
made a basic, but ugly, web page and a basic, but bland, layout for my midterm,
but I chose not to.  I like learning how to do things---in this case, writing a
web page in html with style and expanding my \LaTeX\ capabilities---and when I
get into something I like to do it well.

\subsection*{October 13, 2012}

A mostly uneventful Saturday.
We are still living not knowing (a) if and when I will get a job and
(b) when we will have to move from our apartment.

\subsection*{October 14, 2012}

We had a normal Sunday.
I am becoming more motivated to change my habits: have better Sunday
observance, wake earlier, eat better, etc.

\subsection*{October 15, 2012}

I taught class today and we had family time after I got home.

\subsection*{October 16, 2012}

I worked somewhat on my non-teaching work.
I met with my advisor in the afternoon about our papers.

\subsection*{October 23, 2012}

We went to Birch Aquarium and out to dinner.
It was a nice day with the family.

\subsection*{October 26, 2012}

Another week about news on jobs or housing.
I really hope everything works out.

I had a lousy week because I spent too much time typing up lecture slides for
my class.  I realize now that this is an inefficient task.

\section{}

\subsection*{November 3, 2012}

I am fasting today.

I tried to get in some work on mathematics, but I feel like the day went poorly.

I am increasingly worried about my job prospects.
I still haven't heard any news from the NSA, and it has been a month since I had originally been expecting news about it.
Therefore, I have been forced to earnestly plan and begin to execute a backup plan.
I am now applying for more jobs.
Included in this is academic jobs; however, to get those jobs I have to put in a lot more effort in a short amount of time; I still have to write a research statement and a teaching statement even though I have only a faint idea of how to do these things.

Also, this week we were informed that we would have to move out of our student housing.
We have looked into places to move to.
I am now going to be teaching a class Winter Quarter at UCSD.

Most of all, I want to be able to provide for my family.
I want to be able to go in to work and be able to just work without
having the constant worry hanging over me of how I am going to get money for my family.
It is frustrating that I don't have any job offers.
I hate having things be beyond my control.

\subsection*{November 4, 2012}

Church was good today.

I completed a fast.
I am hoping for some greater insight because of my fast on my predicament.
I really want a job.
It could be that I need to improve my job search, put more time into it,
and by so doing nail down a job by the sweat of my brow.

\subsection*{November 6, 2012}

Today was election day.
I didn't do much other than await election results.

I left the election cycle with a bad taste in my mouth.
I didn't like how I felt going out of it.
In particular, I didn't like the sense of contention I got from other people
posting conflicting views to mine on social media.

I have stewed on many occasions during this election cycle on various issues,
explaining in my head why I hold the positions that I do.  This was
unproductive at best.  I felt bad doing it.  Probably, I don't need to do that,
and I can just rest on the positions I already hold.

In the midst of this, I also found that people were posting opinions
questioning the church.  This was in part because a member of the church was
one of the two candidates.  In stewing over those things, I similarly was not
uplifted.  In these matters, however, I was led back to my core knowledge that
the church is true.  I know that through my witness of the Holy Ghost.  Because
of that, I have lived the gospel.  As far as I can see, it has made me a better
person.  It has shaped me to make good choices.

\subsection*{November 8, 2012}

I worked on things.
In the evening I went on splits with the elders.

I still am getting hung up on political comments.
For some reason I have been taking it very personally.

\subsection*{November 11, 2012}

On Friday I learned that the NSA, which cut their math hiring budget in half,
decided I didn't make the upper half of their potential hires.
Possibly I could get that job at a later date if more money is added to their
budget, but as of now I do not have a position with them.

I feel fine about things.  I have faith that things will work out.
It is just hard for me to sit still while it seems like my hopes for being a
strong provider for my family are being dashed.  I hate living from small
opportunity to small opportunity.

\subsection*{November 12, 2012}

I did some work and some play.
I figured out last week that I don't have an office mate.
I was standing outside my advisor's office and saw that the person who was
originally assigned to me was sharing an office with someone else.  I am
decided that I will use my office much more now.

\subsection*{November 20, 2012}

I just wanted to say that I think it important to maximize my time with my
family and not let work consume me.

As far as school, one of my teaching assistants has been annoyed with me.
It bugs me to not be liked, but all I can do is learn from the experience.

In other news, the test results came back and the exam scores were pretty close
to the marks a typical exam should be at.  My students leaving the exam had me
believe that the scores were horrible and that I would need to curve it.
The thing I finally got about writing exams is that they are not meant for
everyone to pass them.  Sometimes, there are hard questions.  My aforementioned
TA seemed to complain about some of the tough problems on the exam, but it
turned out that there were people who got them correct.  Because I have been
afraid of not being able to curve the class because the grades are so high, I
see the value in having a test where different levels of people score
differently on them.

\subsection*{November 26, 2012}

Over the extended weekend we drove to Utah and back.  I took Anna to
Springville while Allison stayed in St. George to participate in her family's
holiday gift show.  I appreciated the time spent with family.

Now that I am back and deadlines are approaching, I am focused on applying for
(academic) jobs.  At the same time, we are moving houses this week.

\subsection*{November 27, 2012}

I worked into the afternoon typing up my teaching statement.
My goal has been to prepare my application materials for submission by December
1.

I am disappointed that the NSA position didn't work out for me; in my view, it
would have been easy (I have a lot of confidence in myself) and I would have
made lots of money; I would have been set for life, I thought. (There is still
a chance for me there in the future, but I am not holding my breath.)  It made
me sad today to find one of the letters I got from them of a conditional job
offer.

At the
same time I am scared of entering academia.  I feel that no matter what I could
have done over the past month or so, my applications are doomed to fail.  After
googling my peers who got jobs, I notice that their publication records aren't,
on average, any better than mine. Normally this would inspire
hope, but I just don't feel right about it.  I am also scared of
the money involved---if I follow an academic career we will be poor for the
rest of our lives.

At the same time there is a part of me which wants to prove that I can make it
in academia, that I am good enough.

I am still wondering what Heavenly Father has in store for me.

\section{}

\subsection*{December 1, 2012}

We had our moving day.  A lot of unfortunate things happened:
\begin{itemize}
 \item We had to find a babysitter at the last minute after our previously
arranged babysitter was MIA.
 \item After a miscommunication, I came home from a grocery trip with Anna in
my arms, expecting Allison to be home.  She was not inside, and I left my phone
in the car, so I proceeded to carry Anna up and down the stairs to the car and
back, bringing up my phone and a bunch of groceries.  This was the beginning of
a long day of lifting.
 \item Only one brother showed up to help us move. (Bless his heart.)
 \item We were locked out after moving the first item.  The brother who came to
help stayed with us for 20 minutes while we waited for someone to let us in.
As a result we moved only two items with him.
 \item We scratched the door with the couch.  If we had waited a few more
minutes we would have had help with the couch and could have avoided it.
 \item We foolishly decided that I could move everything else large alone.  It
turned out that I couldn't really.  I will never move our mattress alone again.
 \item Allison needed to come to get the U-haul, so I had planned to drive over
to the new place where she was watching Anna and switch.  It turned out the car
was at U-haul, so Allison had to find a babysitter again.
 \item We thought we could take the crib out of the door as is.  We couldn't
because it was too wide.  We spent most of the rest of the day planning on
trashing the crib.  At the end of the day, I figured out how to unscrew the
crib and move it piece by piece.  This would have been easier, however, with
the U-haul and not my car.
 \item In summation, I had to carry most everything big out of our apartment
alone.
 \item When cable was installed, I told the repairman we had not ordered an HD
box when it turned out that Allison had.  There was a lot of confusion among
the two of us about it.
 \item I went to get lunch and there was no parking.  I got lunch at another
place instead.
 \item We missed our ward party because there was still too much to do.
 \item I went to KFC for dinner, and in the car I spilled virtually my entire
soda on myself.
\end{itemize}
It was a hard day, but I appreciated it.

\subsection*{December 2, 2012}

In the morning I figured out how to put Anna's crib together.  I was grateful
it worked out.  We went to church and it was good.  At night we were able to
clean out the apartment.  Unfortunately I could not get our shower head off of
the shower.

\subsection*{December 7, 2012}

Allison and I went to a Killers concert.

\subsection*{December 8, 2012}

Not having a job is really hanging over my head.  I have a few different
tangents off of this.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item I could, in theory, be offered the NSA job somewhere down the
line---maybe in a few months, maybe in a year.  Would I take it, no questions
asked?
 \item I have been applying to academic jobs. My feeling about it all is that I
won't get one.  From a logical perspective, I feel that I need to apply for
these jobs.  From a dreamer's perspective, I feel drawn to academic jobs; it
would be like I could have another chance to prove that I can cut it in
academia.  However, I know that I would be happier having the free time that a
normal job provides.
 \item The other option is a normal job.  Getting a normal job didn't work out
so well the last time I tried.  My tentative plan is to plug away at normal
jobs after I am done applying for academic jobs this month.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{December 9, 2012}

Went to church.

\subsection*{December 12, 2012}

I gave my students their final exam.  The exam was more conceptual than
the midterms.  In the class, the first midterm was way too easy and most
of the class aced it.  The second midterm was at a proper difficulty
level and scores fell along a proper curve.

Students were frustrated that the difficulty of the exams varied so
dramatically.  I agree that this wasn't good and I have gained an appreciation
for how hard it is to write an exam.

It seems that plenty of students struggled mightily with the conceptual
material.  I have started to realize why it is important to test the
students on this.  On the students' homework the ``harder'' problems are the
ones where the students have to think about how to setup a problem.
Arguably developing the skill of setting up a problem is as important as
learning the specific material, if not more so.
I wonder how many students navigated the course by relying on others to help
them set up a problem for them; if there were any such students taking the
final, they must have struggled on this exam.

On this vein, I also started to see that a lot of students came into my class
expecting it to be like high school math.  In high school, you go to class
every day, the teacher tells you how to do a type of problem, and then you do
20 of those.  My stereotype of it is that it is all straightforward.  Students
comments showed they did not like that they couldn't just pick everything up
from the lecture.  

As someone who just gets how to set things up, who just gets conceptual
material, I didn't have an appreciation for the difference in difficulty
between calculus and what came before it.

I also understand the other side.  Students also need a rock solid foundation
of basic technical skills.  They can learn concepts as they go through their
career.  There should be a balance though.  I want students to think.

\subsection*{December 16, 2012}

I was able to finish up my class work so that we could head out to Utah on
Saturday.  We went to church in St. George, and then we drove to Springville.

I had my students comment about what they liked and didn't like about the
class.  It was interesting to read the responses because there are always those
people who say crazy things.

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{photo_5.jpeg}

This one was interesting because the student seemed to blame me for not making
her go to class.  You should always go to class if you want a good grade.  This
student ended up with a C-.

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{photo_4.jpeg}

This one was interesting for a few reasons.
First, the student attacks the test itself as being bad; that accomplishes
nothing; ironically, I thought the test was wonderful because it fit in a ton
of material yet was short enough for everyone to have it be graded quickly and
avoid a mad rush at the end of the exam period.
Second, in class I explained to my
students about the multi-part format; if the student (a) attended lecture,
which I doubt, and (b) payed attention, he could have known this; once again,
even though I put my lecture notes online, it turned out that you need to go to
class. Third, the student claims he had an A going into the final; out of
curiosity I checked back and saw that he didn't have an A going into the final;
he had an 87\% which is over the cusp of a B; this, however, included a below
average score on the easy midterm; that midterm score was technically an A, but
everything else about his performance suggested B- or C+.  The poor final
pushed him down to a C, however.

\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{photo_3.jpeg}

This one was interesting because I set out a final review and specifically
included things in it which would be in some way on the final.  The so-called
old midterms and other classes' tests were actually dissimilar to the actual
final. I wonder if the student would have done better on the final had he
completed the practice problems I set out.

\subsection*{December 18, 2012}

I am frustrated that I can't seem to get work done; I write this not meaning
today but meaning over the past months.

The biggest problem is trying to work from home.
If I am really motivated to work on something I can manage to work at home.
If I am searching for the motivation to do something, I cannot get it done at
home.

The biggest conflict is between Allison and me.  When I am home, she does not
want me to work all the time.  She would rather have me interact with her.
When I try to do work despite it, I feel that she is frustrated with me.  This
past week she also urged me to stay home and try to work instead of going to
school to work.  I need to figure out a way to resolve this.

\subsection*{December 21, 2012}

Negative feedback started coming to my page on ``Ratemyprofessors.com''.  It
has made me change my plans for how I would administer my classes this quarter.
 It has also made me question the resurgent desire to be a teacher.  I am
thinking I will go hard for industry jobs as of now.

\subsection*{December 25, 2012}

We had Christmas Eve last night with my family, and then we woke early, drove
to St. George, and had Christmas with Allison's family.  My mom gave me an iPad
Mini, which Allison thinks is completely superfluous given that I have a
regular-sized iPad already.

Hopefully I can get some work done over the days to come---I haven't done much
of anything work related since Friday.

\subsection*{December 27, 2012}

I worked on some math research, but it felt empty to me.
I need to be in tune with the spirit to figure out what my priorities should be
each day.  One method I plan on using to accomplish this is a daily planning
session.

\subsection*{December 29, 2012}

We went to Las Vegas for a Killers concert.
Honestly, I felt like concerts aren't my thing;
it was exhausting;
it was important for me to go,
however, to support Allison.

\subsection*{December 30, 2012}

Sunday in St. George.

{\em Funniest Funny}: Anna was throwing her food to the dogs from her high
chair. Allison took away a piece of roll from her, and then gave it back.  Anna
took the roll, put it to her mouth like she was going to eat it, and then
sneakily went to give it to the dogs.

\end{document}
