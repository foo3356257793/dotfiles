$$
a^2 - a = 0 \bmod{n}
a*(a-1) = 0 \bmod{n}
$$
We have to look at factors of integers $a*(a-1)$ to
find things which are idempotent.

As an example, $53 \times 73$.
Look for
$$
a = 0 \bmod{53}
a = 1 \bmod{73}
$$
This gives one solution.
The solution is
$$
p( (p^{-1} \bmod{73} )
$$

*Example*.

$4 = 2 ( 2^{-1} \bmod{3} )$.

*Example*.

For $a$, what values is it idempotent at?

Find a factor of $a(a-1)$.  We get
$f \times x$.  Want $x \equiv 1 \bmod{g}$.
Hence we iterate over factors of $(x-1)$.

# Wrong

The answer I computed via brute force is not correct.

**Ideas**.
