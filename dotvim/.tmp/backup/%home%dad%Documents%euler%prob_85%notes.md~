For an $m \times n$ grid, how many subrectangles are there?

In the $x$-direction, the example has $3$ as the width.
There are $6$ different ways to do this:

(0) (1) (2) (01) (12) (012)

In the $y$-direction, the example has $2$ as the height.
There are $3$ ways to do this:

(0) (1) (01)

Therefore we can focus on a product.

Is there a formula for what we can do?

Recursion:

Let $f(n)$ be for $n$.  We have
$$
f(n+1) = f(n) + n+1
$$
This is because to fill $n+1$ directions, we can either (1) not use the last space ($f(n)$) or (2) use the last space ($n+1$ because there is a unique choice for each length $1,\ldots,n+1$ of position which includes the last space).

These are just triangular numbers:
$$
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \; .
$$

We are trying to find
$$
\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\approx 2 \times 10^6 \; .
$$

We might exhaust $m$ to find $n$ which gets closest.

We have
$$
\frac{m(m+1)}{2} \leq 2 \times 10^6
m^2 + m \leq 4 \times 10^6
m = (-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 16 10^6}) / 2
$$
