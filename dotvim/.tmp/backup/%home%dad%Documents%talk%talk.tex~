\maketitle

One of our favorite church songs is ``Keep the
Commandments''.
The commandments are things Heavenly Father has told us to do,
and keeping the commandments means that we obey those things.

The song teaches us that if we keep the commandments, the
Lord will ``send blessings''.  The word blessings means good things
which come to us from the Lord.
Also, when we keep the commandments, we also stay safe.
Remember that the song says, ``keep the commandments: in this there is safety''.

One of the commandments is to honor our father and our mother.
In most every family, mom and dad tell the kids things to do.
It is important kids family to listen to their mom and dad.
Moms and dads are much older than their kids and they know
a lot.  Moms and dads try to teach the kids everything they need
to know for when they are grownups.
They also have to help the kids be safe.
For example, when we do scoot/family walk, mom and dad want
the kids to stay close so that they don't get hit by a car.

This week, we want the Nelson kids to do better at
listening to mom and dad.  One important thing is to listen
the first time mom and dad say something to do, and don't make them
repeat it many times.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
