I should propose an activity for Wednesday.


campfire activity
cast iron chef


Aquanaut?

    1. They passed off #5 (if they went to the activity)
    2. Most of these would be better in the water (at a pool?)
    3. #3 is about boating: should we go boating?

Boys:

    Luke: duty to god and you, pamphlet with family
    duty to god in action  (basically all at home things)
    Ricardo: cast iron chef, stronger faster higher,
    one item of building a better world,

Outdoor activity award:
    1. go to day camp (many of them)

Summertime pack award pin:
-produced items to recognize boys who earned 20 activity badges in the new program are not part of the new program materials. Items such as this are not part 
    Hayden went to all the pack meetings this summer so he gets the
    pin (note: Claire marked some of the boys in June; she didn't
    mark Hayden, but I am positive he was there: I remember
    throwing frisbee with him and his younger brother)
    If Luke went to swimming in August, he gets it too

Nova:
    I would like to do the math one

    One unit: secret codes
        (joint with video clip)

    #2: survey and chart (easy)
        coin toss experiment (easy)
    #3: calculations of how much weigh (easy)
        measure height of stuff: easy with apps (easy)

    #5: how math affects everyday life
        (joint with video clip)

    Recruiter:
        Hayden started bringing his friend
        You get a badge for recruiting a friend into scouting
