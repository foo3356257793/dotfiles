Jun 27: Volleyball at the church, 7 pm

Jun 28: Several families will be moving today.  We encourage you and your families to support these efforts.  More details to come with exact times and places.

Jun 28: Sister Sandy Snyder will be teaching an introductory Karate class in her
home at 9 am. It will be great for all activity levels so come get moving! No men
or children please.

For the Fall Stake Relief Society Event on Sept 13, along with speakers,
musicians, and a service project, they are holding a book exchange. This is
where everyone can bring LDS books, cd's, tapes, and any other type of book
that has LDS standards. Bring those things that you know you won't read or
listen to again and exchange them for others. All of this is free. You freely give
yours and you freely take others. You can bring items each week throughout
the summer.

Next lesson: Bishop’s discretion
