One thought

$$
(\ceil(\sqrt{a}) + \sqrt{a})^n
=
\sum_i {{n}\choose{i}} C^i a^{(n-i)/2}
$$
One could evaluate the even terms of this
sequence modulo $p$.

The problem then is that we have a huge number
times $\sqrt{a}$.

_note_.
Don't even think about actually expanding these things:
far too many terms.

_continued fractions_

Do these help?

$$
(\sqrt{a} + \ceil(\sqrt{a}))^2
=
a + 2\sqrt{a}\ceil(\sqrt{a}) + \ceil(\sqrt{a})^2
$$

_notes_.

If $a$ is a perfect square, we get an integer and this is easy.

_idea_.

On the first pass, I thought that
$$
(a + e)^n = a^n + na^{n-1} e
$$
so we just needed $e \ll na^{n-1}$ to be good.

*Example*.
$$
\sqrt{2} \approx 1 + 1/(2 + (1/2))
$$
Then
$$
(2 + 1 + 1/(2+(1/2)))^2 =
$$

*Idea*.
We need to approximate _some_ of the error terms then.

*Idea*.

$$
(2C)^n - (C + \sqrt{a})^n
=
(C - \sqrt{a})^{n/2} (3C + \sqrt{a})^{n/2}
$$

$$
(4C)^k - (3C + \sqrt{a})^k
=
(C - \sqrt{a})^{k/2} (7C + \sqrt{a})^{k/2}
$$

This comes to
$$
(C + \sqrt{a})^n
=
(2C)^n
+
(\sqrt{a}-C)^{n/2}(\sqrt{a}+3C)^{n/2}
=
(2C)^n
+
(\sqrt{a}-C)^{n/2}(4C)^{n/2}
$$

_Again_.
