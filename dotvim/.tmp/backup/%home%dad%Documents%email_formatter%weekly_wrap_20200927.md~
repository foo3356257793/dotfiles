# Upcoming Activities


## Tuesday, September 29, 5:30--7 PM: Ecourse and painted rock disbursement

We will be meeting to walk the Naval Academy E course. It is a course designed for all levels of participation. Just like last Tuesday, we will meet both groups at the same time and will walk the course in multiple groups. We ask that you wear a mask at the beginning while we wait for everyone to arrive.
Once we are on the course, you're welcome to remove it as we walk.  We recommend dressing in
pants and bringing bug spray and water.

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women!
Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November
15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to
participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from
the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with [this
one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe

Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.
