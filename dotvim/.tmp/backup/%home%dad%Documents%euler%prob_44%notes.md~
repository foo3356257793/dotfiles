$k$ is pentagonal when

$$
k = n(3n-1)/2
3n^2 - n - 2k = 0
$$

Test whether
$$
1 - 4(3)(-2k)
= 1 + 24 k
$$
is a square.

If this is a square, then
$$
n = (1 + \sqrt(1+24k) / 6)
$$

**Pentagonal differences**.

Let $D$ be under consideration.

$D + P_j$ is pentagonal.
What must happen for this?

D + n(3n-1)/2 = m(3m-1)/2

If

D + n(3n-1)/2 = (n+k)(3(n+k)-1)/2

then

2D = 3(n+k)^2 - (n+k) - 3n^2 + n
   = 3n^2 + 6nk + 3k^2 - n-k - 3n^2 + n
   = 6nk + 3k^2 -k

Note that for a fixed n

2D >= 6n + 2
D >= 3n+1

**again**.

D = pentagonal

D = (n+k)(3(n+k)-1)/2 - n(3n-1)/2
2D = 3(n+k)^2 - (n+k) - 3n^2 + n
2D = 3n^2 + 6nk + 3k^2 - n-k - 3n^2 + n
2D = 6nk + 3k^2 -k

k=1 at least, so

2D >= 6n + 2

so

D >= 3n+1

This gives a maximum for what n can be with this D
