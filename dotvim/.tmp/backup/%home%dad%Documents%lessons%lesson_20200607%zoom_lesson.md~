# Outline

* Highlight of the week
* Test out the chat feature
  * What kind of device are you using to access this class:
  form factor and operating system
  *Example*. Laptop, Linux
* Prayer (have a terminal with ``Sage`` open to choose it randomly)

**Lesson**. Alma 5:44-51

Alma 5:45: "I testify unto that I do know that these things are true".

Let's write a recipe for a testimony.

*Idea*. Let them figure out what the "ingredients" and "directions" are supposed to mean here.

The ingredients could just be things we know.

They could add to their recipe from their own experiences
or other experiences in the scriptures.



***backburner***
Alma 5:46:
  * Holy Spirit of God
  * fasted and prayed

# Brainstorming

* Use chat feature
* Use screen sharing somehow
* Try everything

## Things that don't work

* Breakout rooms

# Scripture study

Need to read all of it.  Print it out?

*Alma 5:6*.

# Points

# Alma 5:14--33

**We must experience---and continue to feel---a mighty change of heart**

There were questions in Alma 5:14--33.
Are these meaningful to our class?

# Alma 5:44--51

**We can gain our own witness of the Savior and His gospel through the Holy Ghost**

The manual has people write a "recipe" for a testimony.

*Additional resources*.

Here are steps to gaining a testimony.

1. A desire to believe.
2. Search the scriptures.
3. Do the will of God; keep the commandments.
4. Ponder, fast, and pray.


# Alma 6

**We gather as Saints to hear God's work and do His work**

Imagine someone we know thinks that church is not necessary.

Alma 6 has some of the blessings of belonging to church.

v. 5. Hearing the word of God.
v. 6. Fasting and prayer "in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God".

# Alma 7:7--16

**The Savior took upon Himself our sins, pains, and afflictions.**

How does the Savior actually help us?
