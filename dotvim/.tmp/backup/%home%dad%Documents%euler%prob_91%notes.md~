If we pick a point $(x_1,y_1)$,
we could form a right triangle with a
multiple of $(y_1,-x_1)/\gcd(x_1,y_1)$.
We can either add this to the vector or to the
origin.

There are two lines coming out of the origin.
Consider two cases:

1. The right angle involves both of these lines.
   This is the case where we add a perp vector to the origin.
2. The right angle involves only one of these lines.
   This is the case where we add a perp line to the vector.
