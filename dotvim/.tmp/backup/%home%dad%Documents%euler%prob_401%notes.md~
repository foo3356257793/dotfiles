# description

Find the sum of squares of the divisors,
and then square those.

## Idea

For each value $a$, we can count how many multiples
will have it as a divisor.

For values with the same number of multiples, we can
use a sum of squares formula to add them at once.

At level $n$,
We can look at number of sets of size $1$, $3$, etc.
