</center>

This Saturday, there will be a service activity to rake leaves
at several homes in our ward.  You may recall that this was
originally scheduled for last week, but there was bad weather.

This activity is encouraged to be a family activity.
Groups (and individuals) should sign up here:
[link](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F0D4EA4AF28A2FB6-leaf).
This will help the organizers plan how to divide the work.

Bags will be provided.
There will be a limited number rakes,
so we are being asked to come prepared.


### When

December 12, 8:30 AM

### Where

Meet at the Dunkin Doughnuts on Ritchie Highway (951 Governor Ritchie Hwy,
Arnold, MD 21012).
