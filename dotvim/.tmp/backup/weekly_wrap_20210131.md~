During this virtual version of The Masked Singer, you will be
treated to musical performances by some of our Young Women, Young Men,
and maybe some of our leaders.  The catch: the performers' identities
will be a mystery.  We will have fun guessing which of our friends are
behind each "mask".

responding to this email
or by texting her at (858) 345-0936.

## June 22--26: Girls' Camp


# Sign up to teach

We are asking the young women to help teach our Sunday lessons:

* Every second Sunday we will be split into our two groups (high school and middle school). These lessons will be taught by one or more young woman with assistance from their advisor.
* Every fourth Sunday lesson we will be combined. These lessons will be taught by
a team of one high-school young woman and one middle-school young woman, with help from  advisors as needed.

Please review the schedule at this link:
[Sign-up Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KJdZZVQW5i4J96cOk3BkEdUByU50sfIie4OowG9ybEQ/edit?usp=sharing).
If there is a topic that you are interested in teaching,
   please sign up.

   We would like all of the young women to have the experience of teaching
   a lesson, so we will randomly fill in the schedule with those who
   do not sign up ahead of time.
