# What to do

Code to find number of lattice points in a ball.

For each $a$, look at points of norm $\leq a^2$.

## Counting squarefree integers

Over the integers, this is

$$
\sum \mu(n) \floor{N/n^2}
$$
where $\mu(n)$ is the Mobius function:

$$
\mu(n) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{not squarefree} \\
1 & n = 1 \\
(-1)^k & $k$ \text{distinct prime factors}
\end{cases}
$$

Why does this work?

Consider a point

$$
(p_1^{e_1} \cdots p_n^{e_n})^2 q_1 \cdots q_k
$$

We count this by working with all factors
of $p_1 \cdots p_n$.
This ends us up with
$$
n - {{n}\choose{2}} + {{n \choose{3}} - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {{n}\choose{n}}
$$
Note that
$$
(1-1)^n
=
1 - n + \cdots + (-1)^n
$$
which implies that the above sum equals $1$.

## Counting squarefree Gaussian integers

If we make this same calculation with prime factors over the Gaussian integers,
things should work.

We then consider multiples of $(a+bi)$ with norm $p$.

If $p \equiv 1 \bmod{4}$, then $p$ factors into two.

If $p \equiv 3 \bmod{4}$, then $p$ doesn't factor.

We also consider $2$.  This is a ramified case.
$2$ splits into $(1+i)^2$ (up to a unit).

## Only combing through odd values

How many odd multiples of $p$ in $[1,n]$.
