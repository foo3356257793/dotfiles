Most numbers are bouncy

both incr and decr: aaa...aa (9 of these for n-digits)

Increasing:

Num of ways to fill out 9 digits (must start with >0)
in an n-digit number

(n+9-1) \choose (n)

Decreasing:

Num of ways to fill out 10 digits (OK to start with 0)
in an n-digit number

(n+10-1) \choose (n) - 1

(take away all 0: all others will actually be n-digit numbers)
