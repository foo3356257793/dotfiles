# Notes

For each $L$,
want the number of right triangles
with this perimeter.

Primitive Pythagorean triples are given by

$$
a = m^2 - n^2
b = 2mn
c = m^2 + n^2
$$
Then
$$
a + b + c = 2m^2 + 2mn = 2m(m+n) \; .
$$

For a given $L$, consider the number of primitive triples:

First, $L$ must be even.

Next, factor $L$ as $L/2 = a \times b$.
Let $a < b$.  Then we want $m=a$ and $n=b-a$.
We need $a > b-a$ so $a > b/2$.

# bounds

For

$$
2m(m+n) \leq L
$$
Need
$$
m^2 + m \leq L/2
$$
so
$$
(-1 + sqrt(1 - 4(-L/2)))/2
(-1 + sqrt(1 + 2L))/2
$$

Also want $a<=b$, which is
$$
m^2 - n^2 <= 2mn
$$
$$
0 <= n^2 + 2nm - m^2
(-2m + sqrt(4m^2 + 4m^2))/2
-m + sqrt(2m^2)
-m + sqrt(2)m
$$
