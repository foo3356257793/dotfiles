Alma 32--35

# Alma 32

poor Zoramites cast out of the church

10: "do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?"
11: "do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?"

19:
* know the will of God, don't do it -> cursed
* believe but not know, don't do it -> not as bad

21: faith not a perfect knowledge

23: gives word by angels to men, women, even children

28: the word is a seed

summary:
* if you open your mind to the things of God, you will feel it is true
