# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women!
Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November
15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to
participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from
the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with [this
one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe

Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.
