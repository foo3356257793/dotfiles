Thanks for the email.  Here is what I am thinking.

This may or may not be obvious to everyone, but from my perspective this wasn't expressed clearly in my limited conversations about these online classes: if we are going to have adult supervision, we need to follow the same guidelines we follow in our traditional, in-person classes and have two-deep leadership.  The fact that the setting of these classes is virtual instead of physical shouldn't change the need for this requirement.

In general, I would like for there to be clear expectations about what this is going to be.

What does youth chatting for 15--20 minutes mean?  Does it mean that I mute my microphone and listen to the youth have a random conversation?  Does it mean I take an active role in suggesting uplifting topics?

An idea I will throw out is to adopt schedule which mirrors how our classes work at church:
    - 5-10 minutes mingling time before the lesson
    - 15 minute prepared lesson led by the adults (in whatever format makes
      sense in a video chat)
    - After the lesson is officially over it will end with a closing prayer.
      The adults could both log off and let the youth talk until they're done
      OR the teachers could mute their devices and let the youth chat for a
      determined amount of time. Maybe this should be determined by what age
      group you are teaching since the younger group may need a little more
      supervision and guidance?   Also, maybe an after-lesson conversation will
      not need to be 20 minutes long: at that point, if the youth want to talk
      more, their parents can supervise them.

I am going to be available at 1--2 pm (and am generally flexible on the time I can be available).  I think having it every other week (as we do for in-person church) is a good idea.
