# Ideas

For a given subset, we can figure out values which are forbidden
to add.

Suppose $S$ is the sum.
Let $m$ be the sum of the four smallest and $S-m$ the sum of the three largest.
Then we need $m > S-m$ so that
$m > S/2$.  This should take care of condition ii.

We have to have that subsets are optimal too.
For $2k=1$, look at the $k+1$ smallest elements and the $k$ largest.  We need
that 

## Exhaust

We can represent an ordered tuple

$$
x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_{n-1}
$$

as

$$
(x_0; \delta_1, \ldots, \delta_{n-1})
$$

where
$$
\delta_i = x_i - x_{i-1} - 1 \geq 0 \; .
$$

### Exhaust details

Suppose we want to look through possibilities up to a max sum.

We have
$$
a_0, a_0 + 1 + \delta_1, \ldots, a_0 + 6 + \delta_1 + \cdots + \delta_6
$$
The sum of the first $4$ terms is
$$
a_0
a_0 + 1 + \delta_1
a_0 + 2 + \delta_1 + \delta_2
a_0 + 3 + \delta_1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3
=
4 a_0 + 6 + 3 \delta_1 + 2 \delta_2 + \delta_3
$$
The last three terms
$$
a_0 + 4 + \delta_1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3 + \delta_4
a_0 + 5 + \delta_1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3 + \delta_4 + \delta_5
a_0 + 6 + \delta_1 + \delta_2 + \delta_3 + \delta_4 + \delta_5 + \delta_6
=
3a_0 + 15 + 3 \delta_1 + 2\delta_2 + 3 \delta_3 + 3 \delta_4 + 2\delta_4 + \delta_6
$$
Setting the $\delta_i=0$, we get
$$
4 a_0 + 6 \geq 3 a_0 + 16
$$
so
$$
a_0 \geq 10
$$

The max is going to be
$$
7 a_0 + 21 \leq S
$$
so
$$
a_0 \leq \frac{S}{7} - 3
$$

At index $1$, $\delta_1$ has a coefficient $6$.
At index $2$, $\delta_1$ has a coefficient $5$.

We get a bound for the sum.  We also need to worry about
Condition 2.

$L + a\delta_1 \geq  R + b\delta_1 + 1$
This gives
$$
(L-R) - 1 \geq (b-a) \delta_1
$$

Call this
$$
P - 1 \geq (b-1) \delta_1
$$

1           2      3       4     5     6
$3-3 = 0$, $3-2$,  $3-1$, $3-0$ $2-0$ $1-0$
