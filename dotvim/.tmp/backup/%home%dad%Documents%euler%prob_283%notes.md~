# How to do this?

Want area/perimeter ratios in the integers.

Perimeter always integral.

*Heron's formula*.
$$
s = P/2
A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
$$
This is alternately
$$
A^2 =
  \frac{a+b+c}{2}
  \times
  \frac{-a+b+c}{2}
  \times
  \frac{a-b+c}{2}
  \times
  \frac{a+b-c}{2}
$$
This this square integral?  Not necessarily.

Note
$$
A^2 / P^2 =
\frac{(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}{16(a+b+c)} \; .
$$

*Try*. For $(a,b)$, can we determine all values of $c$
which work?

*Observation*.

Consider a primitive triple $(a,b,c)$.  If we have a square
at all, we can generate a set of valid things:

If $A,P$ are the area and perimeter for $(a,b,c)$,
then $k^2A, kP$ are the area and perimeter for $(ka,kb,kc)$
and $k (A/P)$ is the ratio.

For $a+b+c=1$, what is the minimum area.  We minimize
$$
(-2a+1)
\times
(-2b+1)
\times
(2(a+b)-1)
$$
The optimum must be at $a=b=c$.  In this case
$$
(1/3)^3
$$
is the area.
If we chose $a=0$, $b=c=1/2$, we would be having
$$
0 \; .
$$

For $P = 12$, for example $(3,4,5)$ has area $6$
whereas $(1,4,7)$ has area $0$.

The smallest area triangles are $(1,s,s)$ and $(2,s-1,s)$.
This implies a bound on the perimeter.

$$
(1+2s)(1)(1)(2s-1)/16 = (4s^2-1)/16
$$
$$
4s^2-1 \leq 16 \times 1000
$$
$$
s \leq \sqrt(4000 - 1/4)
$$
so $s \leq 63$.

$$
(2s+1)(1)(3)(2s-3)/16
=
(3/16) (4s^2 - 4s - 3) \leq 1000
$$
$$
4s^2 - 4s - 3 - (16/3)(1000)
$$
$$
s^2 - s - 3/4 - (4/3)(1000)
$$
$$
(1 + \sqrt{1 + 3 + (16/3)(1000)})/2
$$
This gives a bound of $37$ on $s$.

**Idea**.
Exhaust $a$, the minimum side value.
Figure out a bound on $b$.
For each $b$, figure out a bound on $c$.

**Fix**.

Consider a triangle
$(1,s,s)$.  The scaled square area is
$$
4s^2 - 1
$$
The perimeter here is $2s+1$, so the square ratio is
$$
\frac{4s^2-1}{(2s+1)^2}
=
\frac{2s-1}{2s+1} \; .
$$
This isn't typically a square?

**Next**.

$$
P * (a+b-c) * (a-b+c) * (-a+b+c)
$$

We have $b+c$ is $O(P)$.  We then have a bound on $|b-c|$ of
$O(P)$.

Maybe we want to exhaust $c-b$, ($c \geq b$).

# Wikipedia

We are looking at Heronian triangles:
triangles with integer side lengths and
integer area.

**Lesson.**

I could have realized that a triangle having integer
area was a thing which has been studied.

## Form

They all look like

$$
a = n(m^2+k^2)
b = m(n^2+k^2)
c = (m+n)(mn-k^2)
$$
The perimeter is
$$
2mn(m+n)
$$
the area is
$$
mnk(m+n)(mn-k^2)
$$
Need
$$
\gcd(m,n,k) = 1
mn > k^2 \geq 1
m \geq n \geq 1
$$
The ratio should then be
$$
\frac{2mn(m+n)}{mnk(m+n)(mn-k^2)}
=
\frac{2}{k(mn-k^2)} \; .
$$
