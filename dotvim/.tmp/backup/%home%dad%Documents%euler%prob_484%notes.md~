$$
(pq)' = pq' + qp'
= p+q
$$

Next, $\gcd(k,k')$

If $p$ has exponent $1$ in $k$, then
$$
k' = \frac{k}{p} + p (k/p)' \equiv \frac{k}{p} \bmod{p}
$$
and is not divisible by $p$.

If $p$ has larger exponent in $k$, then
$$
k = p^e q
k' = ep^{e-1} q + p^e q'
= p^{e-1} (eq + pq')
$$
We get a factor $p^{e-1}$ here.
To investigate further factors of $p$, we examine
$$
eq + pq' = eq \bmod{p} \; .
$$
If $e \equiv 0 \bmod{p}$, then we get an additional factor of $p$.

This last fact is what makes this tricky.
