\section{1 Nephi}

\subsubsection{Heading}

The heading of 1 Nephi was part of the original text and not added later as the
chapter headings.

\subsubsection{1:17: “Abridgement of the record of my father”}

The first part of 1 Nephi is an abridgement of Lehi’s record.
What part is the abridgement?

\subsection{1 Nephi 1}

\subsubsection{v. 2: “Reformed Egyptian”}

See also Morm. 9:32. It appears that this language was like Hebrew with an
Egyptian alphabet (think Japanese written in an anglicized way).

\subsubsection{v. 4: “Many Prophets”}

In that time the church was not organized as it is today.  God called prophets
through direct revelation, and He called not just one prophet at a time but
many.  We see in Jer. 35:15 a reference to prophets preaching unto Jerusalem.

\subsubsection{v. 8-14: “Throne Theophany”}

I learned about this in an institute class at Utah State, but it appears the
original source is Blake Ostler, "The Throne-Theophany and Prophetic Commission
in 1 Nephi: A Form-Critical Analysis", BYU Studies (26/4): 67-95.  In his work,
Ostler identifies eight characteristics of the throne theophany tale present in
ancient Near Eastern literature.  They are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Historical Introduction
 \item Divine Confrontation
 \item Reaction
 \item Throne Theophany
 \item Commission
 \item Protest
 \item Reassurance
 \item Conclusion
\end{itemize}

Similar experiences were had by Micaiah (1 Kgs. 22:19-22), Isaiah (Isa 6), and
Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:1-3:21), “who had visions of god on his throne preceding their
prophetic calls.”

\subsubsection{v. 19-20: Testimony of the Savior}

The number one reason Lehi was persecuted was for his testimony of the Savior.
It says:
\begin{itemize}
 \item “$\ldots$he truly testified$\ldots$of the coming of the Messiah, and also
the
redemption
of the world. And when they heard these things, they were angry with him; yea,
even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned and slain.”
 \item Hel. 8:22: “Our father Lehi was driven out because of these things.”
 \item Deut. 13:1-10: In the Law of Moses, when someone professed to have had
visions
and teaches to “go and serve other gods” then he was to be killed or stoned.  To
Jersualem, the true Messiah was unknown to them.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{v. 20: “Tender Mercies of the Lord”}

Book of Mormon Institute Manual, 1 Nephi 1:20, p. 13
\begin{quote}
From 1 Nephi 1:20 we learn that through the rest of his writings Nephi is intent
on showing us how the Lord will deliver the righteous. Watch for this repeating
theme throughout 1 Nephi.
\end{quote}

David A. Bednar, Conference Report, Apr. 2005, 105; or Ensign, May 2005, 99-100
\begin{quote}
“I testify that the tender mercies of the Lord are real and that they do not
occur randomly or merely by coincidence. Often the Lord’s timing of His tender
mercies helps us to both discern and acknowledge them.

	“. . . The Lord’s tender mercies are the very personal and
individualized blessings, strength, protection, assurances, guidance,
loving-kindness, consolation, support, and spiritual gifts which we receive from
and because of and through the Lord Jesus Christ. Truly the Lord suits ‘his
mercies according to the conditions of the children of men’ (D\&C 46:15).

	“. . . One of the ways whereby the Savior comes to each of us is through
His abundant and tender mercies. For instance, as you and I face challenges and
tests in our lives, the gift of faith and an appropriate sense of personal
confidence that reaches beyond our own capacity are two examples of the tender
mercies of the Lord. Repentance and forgiveness of sins and peace of conscience
are examples of the tender mercies of the Lord. And the persistence and the
fortitude that enable us to press forward with cheerfulness through physical
limitations and spiritual difficulties are examples of the tender mercies of the
Lord”.
\end{quote}

\subsection{1 Nephi 2}


\subsubsection{v. 1: Blessings come from obedience (D\&C 130:20-21)}

Lehi was blessed for his obedience in preaching the gospel, despite facing
opposition.

\subsubsection{v. 6-7: “river of water” and “altar of stones”}

The phrases “river of water” and “altar of stones” are redundant in English.
However, in the Eastern language spoken by Nephi, this mirrors how the concept
of a river or an altar would be expressed. This, therefore, is evidence of The
Book of Mormon being translated.

\subsubsection{v. 12-13: “they were like unto the Jews, who were at Jerusalem”}

When one considers the disobedient attitude of Laman and Lemuel, one should
remember that their upbring was in Jerusalem.  The general population of
Jerusalem did not believe what Lehi had preached.

\subsubsection{v. 16: Nephi prayed to know the truth}

Nephi had to pray to know that what his father was speaking was true.  He had a
“great desire”, similar to what Alma taught in Alma 32:27.  From a missionary
perspective, this is what investigators need to do.

\subsection{1 Nephi 3}

\subsubsection{Laman and Lemuel}

Although they are traditionally cast as idiotically disobedient, note here in
chapter three that they at least try twice to get the brass plate, even
sacrificing their riches to do so.

\subsubsection{v. 1-10: The journey back to Jerusalem}

Old Book of Mormon Institute Manual
\begin{quote}
The distance from Jerusalem to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aqaba) is about 180
miles through hot, barren country infested anciently by many marauders.  Lehi
and his family traveled three days’ journey beyond this point (see 1 Ne. 2:5-6).
 This meant at least a twelve-to-fourteen day trip one way, which gives added
meaning to Nephi’s response.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{v. 3: How did Lehi know that Laban had the Brass Plates?}

In the 18th year of the reign of Josiah (approx. 622 BC), Hilkiah found the book
of the law in the temple.  See note on 2 Kings 22:8.  At hearing the words of
the book of the law, Josiah rent his clothes (2 Kings 22:11).  The implication
is that he did so because Israel was not keeping what was in the book.  The
other implication is that the scriptures had been lost for some time previous to
this.

	The brass plates existed in Israel in the time of Lehi, which was
approximately 600 BC.  The plates contained the books of Moses, “a record of the
Jews from the beginning, even down to [their day]$\ldots$and also the prophecies
of
the holy prophets” (1 Ne. 5:11-13).  They also contained Lehi’s geneology (1 Ne.
5:14).  These plates contained even more than our current Bible contains.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Question: When were these brass plates created?
\begin{itemize}
 \item If before the book of the law was found, this implies that the priests
were
suppressing the scriptures.  This is not implausible since (a) the scriptures
disappeared for a season and (b) the book of the law was in the temple the whole
time.
 \item If after, how do we reconcile that they had all the genealogy as well.
Why
were they in the hands of Laban?
\begin{itemize}
 \item 1 Ne. 4:26: Laban had some kind of association with the brethren of the
church.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{v. 7: Scripture Mastery Verse}

Seminary Scripture Mastery Card
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Historical Setting:
 \item The Lord told Lehi to send his sons back to Jerusalem to get the brass
plates
from Laban.
 \item Doctrinal Teaching:
 \item The Lord prepares a way for all of us to keep His commandments.
 \item Missionary Application:
 \item Help a nonmember friend realize that God will help him obey the
commandments
to prepare him for baptism.
 \item Personal Application: When the Lord, maybe through a church
	 leader, asks you
to do something, have faith that the Lord will open the way to help you do it.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{v. 7: “I will go and do”}

Russell M. Nelson, Conference Report, Apr. 1984, 76-77; or Ensign, May 1984, 52
\begin{quote}
“I have learned not to put question marks but to use exclamation points when
calls are issued through inspired channels of priesthood government”.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{v. 31: “he can command fifty”}

\begin{itemize}
 \item It is implied here that Laban was a “captain of fifty.”
 \item Isa 3:3(1-3): “The Lord$\ldots$doth take away from Jerusalem$\ldots$The
captain of
fifty.”
 \item What are some historical sources which explain this better?
\begin{itemize}
 \item I can’t really find anything.  I think this just means he was a captain
over fifty soldiers, nothing more.  The only thing that comes up when I searched
Wikipedia were, strange enough, articles about figures in church history who
were captains of fifty.
\end{itemize}
 \item Also included in this is “the cunning artificer.”
\begin{itemize}
 \item 1 Ne. 16:38: Nephi was accused of practicing “cunning arts”
 \item I was presented a theory in an institute class that Nephi was a metal
worker; these verses were a tie in as well as (1) Nephi admired the metal sword
and (2) Nephi was able to make tools from ore--he only asked the Lord where to
find the
ore.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



Hugh Nibley, Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites, p.111
\begin{quote}
A few deft and telling touches resurrect the pompous Laban with photographic
perfection.  We learn in passing that he commanded a garrison of fifty, that he
met in full ceremonial armor with “the elders of the Jews” for secret
consultations by night, that he had control of a treasury, that he was of the
old aristocracy, being a distant relative of Lehi himself, that he probably held
his job because of his ancestors,$\ldots$that his house was the storing place of
very
old records, that he was a large man, short-tempered, crafty, and dangerous, and
to the bargain cruel, greedy, unscrupulous, weak, and given to the drink.
\end{quote}

\subsection{1 Nephi 4}

\subsubsection{v. 6: Following the Spirit}

Nephi here is a good example of following the spirit.  We should not wait to
fully understand why the spirit compels us to do things, but we should have
enough faith to do them despite our lack of knowledge.  As Alma the Younger said
in Alma 32:21, “faith is not to have a perfect knowlegde of things”.

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent John H. Groberg, “Trust in the Lord” [CES fireside for young adults,
May 1, 1994], 3, www.ldsces.org

\begin{quote}
“Be willing to take reasonable risks.  We live in an age of reason, logic,
facts, and figures.  These can be useful if kept in subjection to faith in the
Lord, Jesus Christ.  But if they ever take precedence over faith in Him, then
they are not useful and can be very harmful.  I have found in my life that most
of the good decisions I have made may not have been made if they were based
solely on logic or reason. . . .

	“. . . Nephi was determined to do what God wanted him to do even with
logic to the contrary.  The scriptures tell us in 1 Nephi 4:6 that he went forth
not knowing beforehand what he should do but knowing he should obey God and get
the plates. . . .

	“I suspect had he listened only to reason, Nephi and his brethren would
still be waiting outside the walls of Jerusalem. I sometimes wonder if by our
listening to reason and logic too much, and not trusting God enough, we may find
ourselves waiting outside the walls of His holy city”.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{v. 10: The Lord sometimes commands His servants to “break
commandments”}

Nephi was commanded to kill Laban despite his commandment against killing.  The
greater principle here is that we need to follow the Lord above anything else.
He gave the commandments and He has the authority to make exceptions to them or
to even change them.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Gen. 22:2(2-12), D\&C 132:36: Abraham was commanded to kill Isaac.
 \item D\&C 132:37-39: The Lord also gave several prophets wives and concubines.
 \item Jacob 2:27: The Lord didn’t allow the Nephites of Jacob’s day to have
more
than one wife.
 \item OD 1: At present we are not allowed to have more than one wife.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{v. 13: The Lord slayeth the righteous to bring about His
righteous purposes}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Laban was wicked.  Look at what he had already done in this story.
 \item The scriptures are important.
 \item D\&C 98:23-32: The Lord lays out criteria for justifying striking ones
enemies.
 This passage closes saying “Behold, this is the law I gave unto my servant
Nephi$\ldots$”.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{1 Ne 5}

\subsubsection{v. 1-8: Sariah was a great lady}

After reading the commentary on my LDS Library 2009 disk:
Sariah was a great lady: (1) she followed Lehi into the wilderness on faith, (2)
she raised Nephi.

\subsubsection{v. 10-22: The Brass Plates}

Mormon Doctrine, p.103
\begin{quote}
“There was more on them than there is in the Old Testament as we now have it. (1
Ne. 13:23.) The prophecies of Zenock, Neum, Zenos, Joseph the son of Jacob, and
probably many other prophets were preserved by them, and many of these writings
foretold matters pertaining to the Nephites. (1 Ne. 19:10, 21; 2 Ne. 4:2, 15; 3
Ne. 10:17.)
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{v. 11: “The five books of Moses”}

After reading the commentary on my LDS Library 2009 disk:
This confirms that the first five books of the Bible were written by Moses.

\subsection{1 Nephi 6}

\subsubsection{v. 4: Nephi’s purpose for writing}

Joseph Fielding McConkie and Robert L. Millet, Doctrinal Commentary on the Book
of Mormon, 4 vols., 1:, p.51
\begin{quote}
Nephi was writing upon (and we are now reading from) the small plates, a record
which, incidentally, was written in retrospect, thirty years after the fact.
Nephi desired the limited room on this smaller set of plates for "the things of
God," the things of greatest worth unto the children of men. Such matters as
genealogy-certainly of importance-are to be found on the large plates. Nephi's
hope and intent? "That I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham and
the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved." Some things simply are
more valuable and more conducive to bringing men to Jehovah, who is Christ the
Lord. Nephi and those of his descendants who have editorial responsibilities for
these plates were solemnly selective in what they recorded, always considering
the overall purpose for which this set of plates was written and preserved.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{v. God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob refers to the Savior}

Ezra Taft Benson, “Five Marks of the Divinity of Jesus Christ,” Ensign, Dec.
2010, 10
\begin{quote}
“We must keep in mind who Jesus was before He was born. He was the Creator of
all things, the great Jehovah, the Lamb slain before the foundation of the
world, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He was and is the Holy One of
Israel.”
\end{quote}

\subsection{1 Nephi 7}

\subsubsection{v. 4: Hearing the Words of the Lord}

The elect hear the voice of the lord and harden not their hearts (D\&C 29:7).

\subsection{v. 10-12}

{\it Note from 2012.11.13}

In applying it to oneself, could one replace ``seen an angel of the Lord'' with
``received a witness of the Holy Ghost''?

In my own life I am going through a trial where I don't have a job lined up for
myself.  I should remember that the Lord has helped me this far, so I should
keep trusting in Him to finish the job.

\subsection{1 Nephi 8}

\subsubsection{Interpretation of the Tree of Life Vision}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Dark and dreary waste (v. 7)
 \item Large and spacious field (v. 9): the world (1 Ne. 8:20)
 \item Tree/Fruit (v. 10): the love of God (1 Ne. 11:21-22)
 \item River of water (v. 13): "Hell and the depths thereof" (1 Ne. 12:16;
15:22-32)
 \item Rod of iron (v. 19): the word of God (1 Ne. 11:25; 15:23-25)
 \item Strait and narrow path (v. 20): the way that leads to the Father (i.e.
Jesus Christ)
 \item People who start on the path but are lost in the mist (v. 21-23)
 \item Mist of darkness (v. 23): temptations of the devil (1 Ne. 12:17)
 \item People pressing forward, clinging (v. 24-26): (my thought) those who
enter the church/gospel but fall into worldliness
 \item Great and spacious building (v. 26): the pride of the world (1 Ne.
11:35-36; 12:18)
 \item People continually holding (v. 30): (my thought) those who inherit
eternal life
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{v. 1}
Their journey was well-planned.

\subsubsection{v. 6}
Is it significant that only when Lehi prayed is when he escaped the darkness?

\subsubsection{v. 25}
What do the clingers/ashamed people represent?

\subsubsection{The Great and Spacious Building}

Pres. Boyd K. Packer, Ensign, August 2010, p. 23
\begin{quote}
“Largely because of television, instead of looking over into that spacious
building, we are, in effect, living inside of it.  That is your fate in this
generation.  You are living in that great and spacious building.”
\end{quote}
\begin{itemize}
 \item In what ways am I living in the Great and Spacious building?
 \item How can I move out of it?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{1 Nephi 9}

\subsubsection{v. 6}
The Lord knows the past and the future.

\subsection{1 Nephi 10}

\subsubsection{v. 1}
Note that Nephi is just starting his account.  Chapters 1-9 have been Lehi's
account.

\subsection{1 Nephi 11}

\subsubsection{Look!}
Note how many times Nephi is told to look.

\subsubsection{v. 1}
Why did Nephi get to see his father's vision?  He "desired to" know more, he
"believed the Lord was able to make them known unto" him, and he "pondered in
[his] heart".  In v. 6 the angel notes that he is seeing the vision because he
"believest in the Son of the most high", i.e. he had faith in Christ.
\textit{Is it significant that his knowledge of Christ, i.e. the correct
knowledge of Christ, was not widely believed in his time?}

\subsubsection{v. 11}
Spirits are in the form of men (and presumably women).

\subsection{1 Nephi 12}

\subsection{1 Nephi 13}

\subsection{1 Nephi 14}

\subsubsection{v.1 stumbling blocks}

Personal Thoughts and Questions:
What are the Gentiles’ stumbling blocks?  What are stumbling blocks for me
personally?

\subsubsection{v. 26 others saw the same things}

Personal Research:
Who have seen that vision?
\begin{itemize}
 \item Nephi
 \item John
 \item Moses (Moses 1)
 \item Lehi
 \item Enoch?
 \item The Brother of Jared?
 \item Institute manual implies that this could be connected to the
sealed
portion of the Book of Mormon.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{1 Nephi 15}

\subsubsection{v 27}
Nephi picked something out of the vision that Lehi didn't.  The same thing is
true with the scriptures in our lives--we can pick out different things from
other people.

\subsection{1 Nephi 16}

\subsubsection{v. 1: hard to bear}

Why is choosing the right sometimes hard?

\subsubsection{v. 2: Nephi’s bold words}

Does Nephi set himself up for some of the things that happen to him?  If yes,
then was it necessarily wrong of him?

\subsubsection{v. 3: characteristic of righteousness}

“willing to hearken to the truth”

\subsubsection{1 Nephi 16:18. A Bow “Made of Fine Steel”}

One commentator explained the use of steel in the Book of Mormon:
\begin{quote}
“The overall
question of the use of metals by Book of Mormon cultures is an important topic
that deserves detailed attention [see John Sorenson, An Ancient American Setting
for the Book of Mormon (1985), 277-88]. . . . There are five explicit references
to metal weapons and armor in the Book of Mormon. Two are references to Near
East weapons: ‘the blade [of Laban’s sword] was of the most precious steel’ (1
Nephi 4:9), and Nephi’s bow was made of ‘fine steel’ (1 Nephi 16:18). The
existence of steel (that is, carburized iron) weapons in the Near East in the
early sixth century B.C. has been clearly demonstrated. Robert Maddin writes,
‘To sum up, by the beginning of the seventh century B.C. at the latest, the
blacksmiths of the eastern Mediterranean had mastered two of the processes that
make iron a useful material for tools and weapons: carburizing and quenching’
[“How the Iron Age Began,” Scientific American, Oct. 1977: 131]” (William J.
Hamblin and A. Brent Merrill, “Swords in the Book of Mormon,” in Warfare in the
Book of Mormon, ed. Stephen D. Ricks and William J. Hamblin [1990], 345-46).
\end{quote}

\subsection{1 Nephi 17}

\subsubsection{v 1-2}
Allison made a comment, during her pregnancy, about how this humbled her.

\subsubsection{v. 33-35}
This is why Israel was the Lord's people: they were righteous. (This statement
is one that actually needs to be explained with a lot of qualifiers.)

Question: Is the following thing true: the Lord will establish His
kingdom among each and every people who would receive it as Israel received it?
Or is the following more accurate: in that day, the Lord sent those people who
deserved the gospel to be born into Israel, His pre-determined chosen people?
v 40 "he loveth those who will have him to be their God"

\subsubsection{v 41}
The purpose of the 40 years in the wilderness was to make Israel righteous: "he
did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod"

\subsubsection{v 44}
Laman and Lemuel "are like unto [the Jews of that era]".  It makes them more
credible to consider that they are simply like the common people of the time.
Consider the difference between a faithful member of the church and the common
person of this time.

\subsubsection{v 45}
"Ye have seen an bangel, and he spake unto you."  Are we much different when we
do things we shouldn't despite having had so many spiritual experiences.

\subsection{1 Nephi 18}

\subsubsection{v 4}
It was pointed out to me that after Laman and Lemuel join the efforts that the
ship is built in a small number of verses.

\subsection{1 Nephi 19}

\subsubsection{v. 9}

 Jesus suffered because he loves us.

\subsubsection{v. 10}
 Unknown prophets: Zenock, Neum, Zenos

This is a great passage.

\subsection{2 Nephi 2}

\subsubsection{v. 10}
Because of the atonement we appear before God to be judged. Without it we would
automatically be condemned for sins we have committed.

\subsubsection{v. 12}
If there were no opposition, this life would have no purpose.

\subsubsection{v. 20-25: The mark and the curse}
\label{subsub:2nephi5v20t25}

See $\S$ \ref{subsub:alma3v6t19}.

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Book of Mormon Institute Manual, “2 Nephi 5:20-25. The Lamanites Were
Cursed”, p. 62.
\begin{quote}
It is also explained in verse 21 that so “they might not be enticing unto my
people [the Nephites] the Lord did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them
[the Lamanites].” It would appear that this was done to limit the spreading of
more wickedness. Later Alma suggested this same motive when he explained that
“the skins of the Lamanites were
dark . . . that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might
not mix and believe in incorrect traditions” (Alma 3:6, 8). Throughout scripture
we find warnings of the Lord not to marry unbelievers (see Deuteronomy 7:2-3; 2
Corinthians 6:14); the result of doing so was often that the righteous were
turned away from the Lord (see Deuteronomy 7:4; 1 Kings 11:4; D\&C 74:5).
\end{quote}

\subsection{2 Nephi 9}

\subsubsection{v. 29: The Learned}

I know by the spirit that the gospel is true.  I am blessed to have
this testimony.  I benefit from the blessings I receive when I obey
the gospel.  How sad it would be to not have that.

\subsubsection{Thought 2013.08.24: People}

What kind of people lived in the early Nephite day to elicit such a
strong rebuke of the people.  It could be that a lot of the same
types of people which live today lived in that day.

\subsection{2 Nephi 13}

\subsubsection{v. 3: “law”}

In the Bible version, the Hebrew root refers to the teachings and doctrine.

\subsubsection{v. 3}

Comparing to today, there are not nearly as many people inside the
true church as there are people outside of it.  In even broader
terms, it may be true that there are more ``wicked'' than
``righteous'' by a wide margin.

\section{Alma}

\subsection{Alma 3}

\subsubsection{v. 6-19}
\label{subsub:alma3v6t19}

The curse of the Lamanites was not their skin color, it
was that they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.

See $\S$ \ref{subsub:2nephi5v20t25}.

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Book of Mormon Institute Manual, Alma 3:6-15, p. 174
\begin{quote}
There is a difference between the mark and the curse.  The mark placed upon the
Lamanites was a dark skin (see Alma 3:6).  The curse was not the dark skin but
being “cut off from the presence of the Lord” (2 Nephi 5:20).  Notice that in
both Alma 3:7 and Alma 3:14 the conjunction and is used between the curse and
the mark.  This implies that they are not the same thing.  The people brought
the curse upon themselves: “And even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon
himself his own condemnation” (Alma 3:19).  Through righteousness the curse may
be removed, but the mark may remain as it has with the Lamanites.
\end{quote}

\noindent Joseph Fielding Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, 3:122-23
\begin{quote}
“The dark skin was placed upon the Lamanites so that they could be distinguished
from the Nephites and to keep the two peoples from mixing. The dark skin was the
sign of the curse [not the curse itself]. The curse was the withdrawal of the
Spirit of the Lord. . . .

“The dark skin of those who have come into the Church is no longer to be
considered a sign of the curse. . . . These converts are delightsome and have
the Spirit of the Lord.”
\end{quote}

\subsection{Alma 17}

Note, 2009.01.17:
Ammon only showed his power after he had shown a good example.

\subsection{Alma 24}

\subsubsection{v. 10}

Because they were repenting of sin, the Anti-Nephi-Lehis chose to
stay far away from committing the same sins as they had previously.

\subsection{Alma 30}

\subsubsection{v. 55-56}

Interesting that the curse was not taken from Korihor because he
``wouldst again lead away the hearts of [the] people''.  Contrast
with Zeezrom (Alma 15:8-11).

\subsection{Alma 34}

\subsubsection{v. 7-8}

Some of the prophets mentioned as being testimonies of Christ are
prophets not appearing in the {\it Bible}.  Were they withheld
because of their strong, clear testimonies of Christ?  By contrast,
the {\it Book of Mormon} plainly testifies of Jesus Christ, even in
parts which chronologically took place before His coming to the
world.

\subsubsection{v. 8}

The main thing Christ did for us is the lead of this testimony, that
He came ``to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and
that he [atoned] for the sins of the world''.

\subsubsection{v. 9}

``\ldots according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be
an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish\ldots''.

This point says to me that the whole design of our life on earth
hinges upon an atonement being made.  I know the above to be true.

\subsubsection{v. 10}

All ordinances/ceremonies in gospel history are symbols of Christ's
atonement.

\subsubsection{v. 11-12}

These verses mention how the atonement satisfies the law.  There is
discussion of how the atonement must be infinite else the law would
not be satisfied.

\subsection{Alma 48}

\subsubsection{v. 24}

This is an interesting contrast to the Anti-Nephi-Lehis who laid
down their lives so that they would not have to take up arms.  These
people justified taking up arms to defend their families.  It seems
to me that the {\it Book of Mormon} doesn't make a case for which of
these approaches is morally superior.  It seems that the
circumstances dictated what was appropriate here.

\subsection{Alma 63}

\subsubsection{v. 49}

These people went through such a great affliction (long wars) that
they were not quick to forget the Lord.

\section{Helaman}

{\it Thought 2014.02.03} Interesting developments in this book are
(1) a flip to the Lamanites being more righteous than the Nephites
and (2) the rise of the Gadianton robbers.	

\subsection{Helaman 1}

\subsubsection{v. 15-16}

The leaders of the Lamanites turned out to be strong Nephite
dissenters.

\subsubsection{v. 18}

In the war chapters whenever the Nephites have contentions and power
struggles, they lose to the Lamanites.

\subsubsection{v. 18}

If we forget to strengthen ourselves in points which we consider
strong, they will eventually become weaknesses by which we may
stumble.

\subsection{Helaman 5}
\subsubsection{v. 12: Sure foundation}

{\it Thought, 2013.04.06:}
If we build our lives upon Christ's gospel, we can trust that our decisions
will be blessed by heaven.  It makes it easy to live life.

\subsection{Helaman 12}
\subsubsection{v. 1}

{\it Thought, 2014.02.03} I can see that I have a ``false\ldots
unsteady heart''.  I know that when I keep good habits and do
everything I am supposed to do that I feel good and that I prosper.
However, how often do I forget this and be lazy and entertain myself
before I do important things?

\section{3 Nephi}

\subsection{3 Nephi 11}
\subsubsection{v. 21-27: Does the Savior institute baptisms for the dead here?}

In the temple, at a group baptism session, our temple president in San Diego,
Pres. Bruce Olson, opined that the Savior institutes baptisms for the dead here.
 What are some of the evidences of this?
\begin{enumerate}
 \item He was at the temple.
 \item Baptism for the dead was practiced by the saints in the old world after
the atonement was performed (see 1 Cor 15:29)
\end{enumerate}

\section{4 Nephi}

\section{Mormon}

\section{Ether}

\subsection{Ether 2}

\subsubsection{v. 23: Where did the brother of Jared get his idea}

Did the brother of Jared ask for glowing stones because he read about Noah’s ark
having those same kinds of stones?
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Ether 2:23: “ye cannot have windows”.  Note that the footnote refers
to Gen. 6:16.
 \item Gen. 6:16: the ark had “windows”.  The Heb. footnote gives tsohar and
notes that “some rabbis believed it was a precious stone that shone in the ark”.
 \item For deeper study, see the Hebrew Bible dictionary.
 \item Hugh Nibley, An Approach to the Book of Mormon, 3rd ed., p.348: This
talks about how the Rabbis’ traditions were that the stone wasn’t so much of a
light as that it indicated night and day, which was important for the
observation of certain laws (e.g. Sabbath observation).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Ether 13}

\subsubsection{v. 5: Question}

Is Jerusalem yet to be destroyed?  It says here that Jerusalem “after it should
be destroyed it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord.”  As far as
I can tell, it has not been a holy city since Lehi left it.

\subsubsection{v. 7: “he” died there}

I interpret this as meaning Jacob died there.
