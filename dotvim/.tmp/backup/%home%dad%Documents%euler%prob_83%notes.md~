# Idea

Keep track of a set of border points.
Initialize to (0,0).
Keep track of the minimum path to points visited.

For the minimum weight point in the set of border points,
we can fill in all neighbors.  Remove the old minimum from the
border set.  Check whether the new points are border points.

_Proof_.

We set up the border so that we have visited all points
in the region from the border to the top corner.  To visit a new point,
we have to pass through _some_ border point.  We are guaranteed minimal
if we pass through the minimum weight point.

**Claim**. This terminates.

_Proof_. There is a minimum at each iteration, and we visit at least
one point.
