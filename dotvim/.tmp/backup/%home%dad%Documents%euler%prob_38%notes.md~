# One approach

Exhaust the pandigital numbers from largest to smallest.

Go over heads of these numbers of various sizes.  Multiply by $2$ to see if we match the next digits.  If we get the next digits, try $3$ etc.

Stop when we get a hit.

# Approach

Maybe not efficient yet.

Exhaust over lengths of the generator.
Fill in inductively.
For each length, stop when we get a single hit.

Take the maximum we find.
