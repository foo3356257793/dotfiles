# What is s(n)

I think what you do is fill in as large a digit as you can for the low
numbers inductively.

# What is S(n)

$S(9) = \sum_1^9 i = 45$.

$$
S(19) = 45
+ 10 \times 45
+ 10 \times 9
$$

$$
S(100)
=
(100-8) \times 9
+
(100-17) \times 90
+
(100-26) \times 900
+
\cdots
$$

# Note

Another formula is
$s(n) = (10^{\floor{n/9}} - 1) + (n \bmod{9}) 10^{\floor{n/9}}$
$$
s(n) = (1 + (n\bmod{9}))10^{\floor{n/9}} - 1
$$

We get
$$
\sum_{9}^{18} s(n) = 9 + 19 + 29 + 39 + ... + 99
= 45 * 10 + 9 * 10
= (54) * 10
$$

*note*.
If we are using
$$
(1 + (n\bmod{9}))10^{\floor{n/9}} - 1
$$
then $s(n)+1$ is a multiple of $10^{\floor{n/9}}$.

It looks like $S(n)$ is something like
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\floor{n/10}} 45 \times 10^i
+ t 10^{\floor{n/10}}
$$
(Fix this.)
The sum can then be put into a geometric series thing
$$
(45 + t)(10^{m+1} - 1)
$$

We could then probably do another thing with this.

# Again

$s(n)$ is

$$
10^{\floor{n/9}} - 1
+
(n \bmod{9}) \times 10^{\floor{n/9}}
=
(1 + n\bmod{9}) 10^{\floor{n/9}} - 1
$$

Next we want to sum these.

Consider the contribution of the low terms.
It goes up to $45$.  Then we add in a multiple of $9$.

$$
45 + 9 (n-9)
$$

**Example**.

For something of the form
$n \to 9...9$, what is the formula
$$
45 \times 10^{-1+n/9} + 9 \times (10^{-1+n/9} - 1)
=
10^{-1+n/9} (45 + 9) - 9
=
54 10^{-1+n/9} - 9
$$
We then sum these
$$
\sum_{k} (54 \cdot 10^k - 9)
$$
