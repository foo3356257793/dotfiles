# Work out examples

1,3,4,7,15,16

For $16$ popcount is $1$.
Needs to play $|a| + |n-a| = 1$

$2,6,8$.

On $2$, this makes the popcount even.
E can just play $1$.

On $6$, the popcount is odd.


# Observations

If O plays $a$ and $|a| + |n-a| = |n| \bmod{2}$,
then E plays $n-a$ and wins.

If the popcount is odd and E is on something
with even popcount that O wins, then E will win.

# Notes

E wins on 11...1 or 0...01 is a power of 4.

O wins otherwise.

Consider

1..10..01


If the length is even, clear low bits and move top bit down one.
This shifts to a power of $4$ with flipped parity.

If length is odd, unclear?

Example:

 11001
-001
 -----
 1111

# Brute force

Check if O can guarantee a win as follows.

Consider a move $a$.  We have $n - a = b$.

We need $W(a)+W(b) \neq W(b)$, else an easy win for E.

If we do have this condition, O needs $b$ to be in the win set for E.
Cheaper, probably, to exhaust the win set for E to look for good moves.

*fails*. We have to go up to $2^N$, where $N$ is quite large.

E wins on $11...1$ or on power of $4$.

For $*..01$, O wins if $*..1$ is an E win.


*case*.

If $a$ has odd popcount and E win, then $2a$ is O win:

$2a - a = a$.

**Example**.

$10011$ is E win.
