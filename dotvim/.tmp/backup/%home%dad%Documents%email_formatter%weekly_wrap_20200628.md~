We are so blessed to have you, the Young Women, lead our Sunday discussions.  We have created a sign-up sheet that you can choose which date works best for you to lead a discussion.
The sign-up sheet will cover the rest of the year so please sign up for two slots in your respective group: middle school or high school.  

We are also blessed to have two wonderful advisors: Sister Bullough who will work with the Middle School group and Sister Fairbanks who works with the High School group. They are happy to offer you any support you may need.

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women! Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November 15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with
[this one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe
Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.
