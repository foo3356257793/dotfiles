## caps to escape

See i3 file.
Put commands in ~/.config/openbox/autostart

## Background

Using nitrogen

Set keyboard shortcut (super-b) to open the config.

## Volume control

Set up `dunst` for my notifications.
(This was already being used, but with a weird config?)
Downloaded some scripts to handle this.

## rofi

I set a shortcut for it.
``
rofi -show drun
``
seems good as an application launchergood as an application launcher.

## Panel

Using polybar.  Seems fine for now.

Made it transparent and matching the terminal.

Got battery monitor to work.
Tried to write a Python script to get combined battery:
doesn't work in general.

Modified volume stuff to not use a notification anymore:
can just see the effect in the polybar.

## Resize windows

Put in basic shortcuts (with gaps)

# TODO

## Panel

Not that great:

  * Wifi
  * Power popup is flawed


## Multi-monitor support

Probably this doesn't work by default

## convenient positioning

I was wanting to put the time in the top right corner.

With polybar, the panel just sits over maximized windows, which is inconvenient.

Another idea is to use conky.
My initial attempts weren't working: I couldn't get it off of the top left corner.

## Battery

power management
* When I close laptop, good things happen? (lock screen...)

## Headerbars

Style headerbars in a minimal way (have 1977 theme now; maybe no headers?)

## Notifications

Style dunst notifications nicely

## Brightness

Brightness notifications
Add to polybar

## Workspaces

* have 8 of them (enough)
  * create and delete them manually like in my tmux config
  * get it like gnome 3
* Have vertical workspaces

## google print, etc.

cloud print is going away at the end of 2020
need to get a solution working in general

google accounts via gnome settings:
  * these work sometimes?


## resources

how many resources am I taking up in the minimal environments?
(I am loading in some GNOME settings by default;
do I need to do this?)
does the gnome-keyring-daemon make it significantly worse?

## calendar

want an easy calendar tool

## program launcher

using rofi currently:
  * theme
  * use for more than launching programs?  Find pdfs?  Or do I like the terminal for that?

## For kids

One idea is that this setup could be more stable than GNOME
(which seems to struggle with multiple users)

* dock
* easy way to find all of the applications (games)
