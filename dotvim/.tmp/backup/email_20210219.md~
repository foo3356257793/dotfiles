We will be kicking off our in person activities this upcoming Tuesday (2/23) with a fun activity - we will be ice skating at the Glen Burnie ice rink! This facility encourages the advanced purchase of tickets so we need to know which girls will be attending the activity in order to do so.  We want to purchase the tickets by tomorrow night so please respond to this email and let us know if you (or your child) will be attending. If we do not hear back from you we will be reaching out to you personally to ensure everyone has the chance to attend.
