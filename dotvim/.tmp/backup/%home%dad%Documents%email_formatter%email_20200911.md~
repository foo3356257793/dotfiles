# In-person class presidency meeting

Hello wonderful class presidencies!

Normally we would have our monthly class presidency meeting the second Sunday of the month over Zoom, but this month we're going to do it in person! We will be meeting on Tuesday at 6:30 PM, a half hour before the weekly activity.
This meeting will only be for 25 minutes, so please arrive on time.

Thank you for all you do! We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday!
