#Problem

Finding

$(k-m)^2 + ... + k^2 = (n+1)^2 + .. + (n+m)^2$

for $m > 0$ and $n \geq k$.

Find the sum of all of these up to $10^{10}$.

# Ideas

Look at sum of squares formula.

$$
(n/3)(n+1)(n+1/2)
=
n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 \; .
$$

We want

$$
-m(m+1)(2m+1)/6
+
k(k+1)(2k+1)/6
=
-n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
+
(n+m)(n+m+1)(2(n+m)+1)/6
$$

**Observation**.

Modulo $m$, we have
$$
k(k+1)(2k+1)/6
= 0 \bmod{m} \; .
$$
For example,
$$
3^2 + 4^2 = 25 = 0 \bmod{1}
$$
