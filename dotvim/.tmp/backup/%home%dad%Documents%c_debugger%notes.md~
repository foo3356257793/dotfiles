# TODO

* How to use this with autotools
* Learn the commands (cheatsheet?)


# Notes

Compile with debugging symbols
```bash
-g
```

Open the debugger on the file
```bash
gdb [executable]
```

Set a breakpoint
```bash
b [line num]
```

Start the program
```bash
run
```
or
```bash
r


Step to next line
```bash
next
```
or
```bash
n
```

Print out a variable
```bash
p [varname]
```

Continue to next breakpoint
```bash
c
```

Continue to 10 breakpoints
```bash
c 10
```

Kill the program being run
```bash
kill
```
or
```bash
k
```

Quit
```bash
q
```

## threads

```bash
info threads
```
prints out stuff about threads

```bash
thread [num]
```
switch to a thread


## gmp

you can print a gmp variable as is
not that helpful

you can put a `gmp_printf` in the code and
step through it so that it doesn't spam you

I also found out you can do this
```
(gdb) call ((void) __gmp_printf("%Zd\n", a))
```
and it prints stuff out.

## autotools

random thing which might be helpful
```bash
libtool --mode=execute gdb [prog]
```
or this
```bash
./configure CXXFLAGS="-g -O0"
make
libtool --mode=execute gdb --arg [prog] [arg_list]
```

I should spin up a quick example of autotools.
