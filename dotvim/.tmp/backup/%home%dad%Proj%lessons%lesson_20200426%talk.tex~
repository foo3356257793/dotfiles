\maketitle

Last week I talked about the First Article of Faith
\begin{quotation}
  We believe in God, the Eternal Father,
  and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.
\end{quotation}

Today I want to talk about the Holy Ghost.
Another name for the Holy Ghost is the spirit.

Sometimes when we say our prayers, we ask
that the spirit can be with us.  This means that
we want to feel the Holy Ghost.

The Holy Ghost is a spirit without a body of flesh and bones.

The Holy Ghost can help us in our lives.
Sometimes, when we are making a right choice,
we feel a nice happy feeling in our hearts.
Sometimes, when we are making a wrong choice,
we feel a yucky sad feeling in our hearts.

Sometimes our brains don't know which choice is
right or wrong, but the Holy Ghost knows.
The scriptures say:
\begin{quotation}
  the Holy Ghost \ldots will show unto you all
  things what ye should do.
\end{quotation}

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
