\subsection*{January 13, 2013}

This school quarter I am teaching two calculus classes: Math 10A and
20A.  Both classes cover the same material, but one class is for
engineers and hard scientists (i.e. is harder) and one class is for
biologists and economists and others (i.e. is easier).  I am making
twice as much money as I was last quarter, which I am happy about.

On Thursday and Friday I went to the Joint Mathematics Meetings,
which conveniently were held in San Diego this year.  My advisor Dr.
Helton has been good to me as my advisor, and in his talk he was
very enthusiastic about my work.  I am grateful for him.

I have had a lot of thoughts lately about how I spend my time with
my family.  It is increasingly apparent to me that if I don't spend
quantity time and quality time with my family now, I will regret it
for the rest of my life.  I am especially mindful of this because of
my job search.  I need a job that will let me spend time with my
family.

On the job question, I still see the dramatic trade off between
academia and industry.  Over the past year or so I have really come
into my own as an academic.

As I launch onto this tangent, I start by saying it's very ironic.
At the end of 2011, I was full bore set on industry.  Even before
that, I didn't do what was necessary to be a great academic.  Then
over the holidays, I was able to provide the missing piece of the
``Left Nullstellensatz''.  I was filled with pride over this
accomplishment.  It seemed like a great way to cap my academic
career.  The biggest problem I had tackled to that point was now
solved by me.

I had another result before summer hit, but basically I was resting
upon my dissertation and this new result as the whole of my academic
portfolio.  However, I did not have a job lined up upon graduation.
My advisor kindly gave me funding over the summer.  I still was
searching for a industry job, and I would have a couple interviews
over the summer.  However, it turned out that I was able to come up
with more results over the summer.  From my summer work will come
two papers.  I started to grasp how to do successful research as an
academic.  It was ironic because really I had the government job in my
grasp---or so I thought.

The government job fell through, so on my advisor's advice I started
applying for postdocs.  I also have been applying for normal jobs.
The allure of academia is that I have started to believe that I have
real talent and potential for success.  I would find it satisfying
to discover a lot of new mathematical results.  On the other hand, a
higher-paying, less-demanding, non-academic job would provide me
with a more stable lifestyle.  I just want, more than anything else,
to do what is right in the Lord's eyes and to do what is right for
my family.

Another tangent is sports.  I find them addicting, yet in my mind I
know that they should never take my attention away from my family.

\subsection*{January 16, 2013}

I took a nap in the middle of the day.
I have not had great sleeping habits.
The positive though is that I have been good about waking up when Anna wakes
up, which means I get to play with her for a bit in the morning.  However, I
would like to shift my priorities so that I get to bed early so that by the
time Anna wakes up I am well rested.

I am trying to finish my big project from Summer.
It is a long paper.  I am wondering if I need to split it into two papers.
I need to ask my advisor for advice.  I also need to make sure it is all
the way revised.

\subsection*{January 17, 2013}

I am struggling a bit with my schedule.
I want to keep an early to bed, early to rise schedule, but I have not been
going to bed at a good time.

I went to ward basketball tonight, but I think it might be the last night for a
while.  I would rather have my time.

\subsection*{January 20, 2013}

I have been so stressed this week that I have started to feel my heartbeat in
my stomach.  I am having a hard time understanding the issues at hand myself,
but here is what I gather.

First, I have been applying for academic jobs despite my gut feelings not to.

Over 2012, I felt myself having a lot more success with research.
As of now, I have supreme confidence in myself that I could be a successful
researcher.  At the conference last week, my confidence was boosted even higher
by kind words: in my advisor's talk, he said nice things about me; his
colleague, with whom I worked as well on some papers, said glowing things about
me as well; his attitude was that I would be successful in getting an academic
post because of my strong letters of recommendation.

Another aspect is that in comparing academic research to the real world, I am
somewhat soured on the idea of ``real world'' research.  Additionally, my skill
set has holes in it: computing skills and statistical experience.  I am
starting to picture myself in non-academic jobs that I hate but that I do for
the money and work-life balance.

Of course, I know why I should avoid non-academic jobs.  I hate teaching.
(Incidentally, my student reviews came back, and they hated me.)  Further, the
work-life balance is not as good.  Likely I would not be able to live
where I would like to with a non-academic job.  Finally, the money is a lot
less, which will be a hard lifestyle.

\subsection*{January 21, 2012}

I spent the better part of the afternoon with my family.
We went to the mall and Anna slid down the slide a few times.
When we got home I made crepes.

A lesson I learned was about priorities.
Over the past while my habit has been to spend spare moments thinking about
work.  I daydream about success at work.  Why should I not spend my spare
moments thinking about family?  Instead of living to work, I should work to
live, and live for my family.

\subsection*{January 23, 2012}

I had a moment tonight that has really motivated me to find employment outside
of academia.

In my Math 10A class, I set up a survey for my students to tell me what they
think.  A few days ago, one of my TAs relayed some (strong) criticisms which my
students had told her about me.  I wanted to find out what the class as a whole
thought of me.  I had done this last quarter with some success as well.

Instead of the way I did it last quarter---on the students exams, which was not
optimal for a lot of reasons---I figured out how to do it on the university's
``Ted'' website.  The way it was set up was so that it would be perfectly
anonymous, but I would still get to give students credit for doing it.

I think that making it anonymous had the effect of really liberating the
students to say what they truly thought.

I still only have a portion of all the students' thoughts.
There were some negative responses which I agreed with.  There were others
which were completely off base; one student says I mimic the wording in the
book when I never read the book at all.
I received the most scathing response I have ever received in anything.  Here
it is:
\begin{quote}
 This email is the first one in which I feel strongly enough about amatter that
I am compelled to write to UCSD staff / faculty to requestan evaluation of a
professor. I am writing to you because most of thestudents in my Math 10A
lecture course taught by Nelson are eithersitting in confusion, repeatedly
asking questions because theprofessor cannot adequately answer them, or are
currently walking outof class out their frustration (because he is not
addressing classconcerns).I believe the reason for this is because Mr. Nelson is
not initiallypresenting the material in a manner that is cohesive
andunderstandable. Thus, it throws off a good number of students in theclass,
leading to excessive questions arising in class, and finallyresulting in their
walking out. To present it as an analogy, it's liketeaching a kid the ABCs, not
in order, but in a disorganized manner.When you finally ask the child to sing
the ABC song, they don't reallyknow the order, and may skip a few letters in
between.Class is somewhat like this:The professor teaches us A, then R, then C,
then B, then Z, then S,but never does it in a sequenced, organized manner that
is thorough.Additionally, he will teach us the letter A, but will not tell us
thepurpose, the pronunciation, etc.
 He never clarifies what he's asking, what he's doing, jumps around from topicto
topic, and can hardly clear up confusion. The reason why so manyquestions arose
in lecture this morning is because he changed subjects without specifying whathe
was doing or talking about, which left many thinking ,"what's happening?"I sat
in on Dr. Laura Stevens' 10A course last quarter for a couple ofweeks but could
not commit to the time. What I learned from herteaching has enabled me to
understand the material as much as I do,without much problems; that is also why
I am able to see all of theimportant details that Professor Nelson is omitting
during hislecture, which is causing so much confusion. Furthermore, because
themanner in which he presents the material doesn't flow smoothly fromtopic to
topic (as shown in the ABC example), students get veryfrustrated. Even though I
know the first chapter because of Dr.Stevens' course, I purposely asked a
question that I knew the answerto, simply to evaluate if he could answer
adequately. Sadly, he wasnot, and I did this on multiple occasions. I even asked
questions whenhe presented material differently than what I had seen and I
didn'tquite understand what he was doing. I ended up being frustrated likethe
other students too.Even though I understood what some of the students were
asking becauseI used to have those questions too, I could not answer because I
amnot the professor. I wish that I could have shared what I learned inorder to
answer their questions, because the professor left themhanging. For example, a
student would ask about RED but the professortalks about ORANGE.I asked a
question today, which I was truly confused about. The classasked many many
questions, but worded differently because theprofessor was not explaining /
answering it to clear up confusion.When I put my hand down in frustration when
he gave an explanationthat did not answer the question, a student sitting next
to me lookedover and said, "but that didn't answer your question." I looked
overin disappointment and replied, "I know."We as students cannot keep sitting
in class wasting our tuition onsomeone who cannot teach. He may know and
understand the material, buthe cannot teach it. I have to find a means to get
help from a calculustutor, Professor Hummon, Dr. Stevens, or any other excellent
calculusprofessor who truly enjoys teaching, because Professor Nelson
cannot.Although he is nice, I'm not going to learn the material from him, andI
cannot do well without learning it. All I want to do is learn thematerial and do
well in the class. I'm beginning to think that lectureis useless, because I
leave more confused then when I walked in. Icannot wait to get to velocity and
proceed in the course, becauselecture is going to be a mess.If Professor Nelson
continues to teach this way (all over the place),then UCSD will only produce
failures. As a student has said onRateMyProfessor.com before, "I found him to be
a nice guy, but I couldnot learn or understand a thing from his lectures. I had
to resort toself-studying and having friends teach me the material...it was
quitefrustrating to have to learn the material by myself if I wanted
tounderstand it."That is exactly how many of us feel, and it is not fair to have
toteach ourselves the very foundations that we are paying someone tohelp us lay.
I still go to the calculus lab and read the chapter to CLARIFY questions; but I
should not have to TEACH myself a chapterthat my seasoned professor gets paid to
teach.
\end{quote}

A lot of this is hyperbole,
and I don't feel that this particular student is rating me fairly, however,
it really did make me feel that I am
not cut out to be a teacher.
Also, it is interesting to me that this unusually
long response started by the student saying they wanted administration to come
evaluate me. (I created the survey and I am the only one who will see the
responses.)

In the moment I read this, I decided once and for all to leave academia.
It felt as if a great burden was to be free from the other side of academia,
trying to come up with results.  I think this is the answer to prayers which I
have been avoiding.  On the other hand, how do I proceed from here?  I haven't
been applying to non-academic jobs.
Everything is in the Lord's hands.

\subsection*{January 24, 2013}

I am not really doing much today.
I am listening for what I am supposed to do with my time.
I have not been doing a good job at listening lately.

\subsection*{January 28, 2012}

I had a really intense a last few days.

Last Wednesday, I gave my 10A students a survey to find out how I was doing.
One of my TAs had previously told me that the students had some complaints, so
I was aware that there was negative feedback to be heard.  What happened,
however, shook me to my core.  The students blasted me, tore me apart.  The
positive was that I figured out simple areas where I was lacking: not labeling
what section of the book I was covering, using the wrong color of chalk,
and---I realized this based on student comments---not really hearing student
questions in the large lecture hall.  One comment, however, stood out, and I
mentioned this is in a previous entry.  It turned out, however, that this
student probably also got the attention of the mathematics department.

Last
Friday, I saw the head teacher in the department pop into the back of my
lecture; it was a blessing, however, that I had a midterm that day, so he left
after he realized it.  I then had all weekend to stew about this.  I did a bad
job at letting it stress me out.  It was a relief, therefore, when today came
and I finally got to teach my class.  Once again, this head teacher was sitting
in the back of my class, ominously, writing things down.  I did my best to
prepare a great lecture: to respond to not labeling what I was doing, I wrote
a lecture outline, and then I zealously labeled everything; to respond to the
point about the chalkboard, I figured out that I could get yellow chalk from the
department supply room; to respond to not hearing questions, I did my best to
actually hear questions and follow up on them.  I told one of my better jokes,
and for one part of the lecture I prepared a real world connection to the
principles I was teaching to better connect to the class.  On the other hand,
all of my true flaws showed, and it didn't help that I was super nervous to be
on the verge of getting the smack down from the professor monitoring me; I
stumbled over my words; there was an unclear thing in one of my demonstrations;
another one of my explanations was just lousy.

On the other hand, I'm really stressing myself out for no reason.
I now know that I need to get a non-academic job.
Explaining things to others is not my forte, and teaching math is not my
passion.
I don't know what will come of this ``evaluation'', but to a point it's
irrelevant; I'm not teaching anymore after this quarter; my logical self also
doubts that I could get fired prematurely as long as I am doing ``OK''.

However, it does bug me that the class has, for the most part, turned against
me.

Also, my other class has been adequate; they don't hate me I think.

\subsection*{January 29, 2013}

My teaching evaluation wasn't as tragic as I had assumed.
My lecture ended up not having any of the flaws that the angry student said my
lectures had had.  It turned out that the teaching head said that he would have
come to my class last quarter, but he didn't get around to it.

\subsection*{January 30, 2013}

I taught some classes, took a nap, and played basketball at night.
I feel like I have been losing weight because I was very light on my feet at
basketball.

\subsection*{January 31, 2013}

I didn't do much today.  I'm at a bit of a loss for what to do with my
unstructured time these days.  I have been focusing on meeting my teaching
obligations and nothing else.

Allison told me about how my poor social skills have been hard on her.
I need to work on it.  The problem is that (1) I am comfortable not having
social skills and (2) I have never had social skills in my adult life, so where
do I start?

\subsection*{February 4, 2013}

My classes today were adequate.
It looks like I will have an interview in New York this weekend and an
interview at BYU next week.  This means I will miss three days of school.
I plan on having my class watch some video lectures.

\subsection*{February 7, 2013}

I have another crisis with my teaching.
For some reason I thought it would be fine to substitute my teaching this
quarter with videos.  It turns out that that is way off base.  My advisor Dr.
Helton told me I need to find someone to cover my classes ASAP.
I'm doing a horrible job with my classes this quarter. {\it Update:} It looks
like my advisor will be teaching my classes.

I definitely do not want to teach next quarter.  It has stressed me out big
time this past month and a half.

{\it Update:} According to Allison, my flight from New York is canceled on
Saturday due to weather. We will see how things stand.

\subsection*{February 8, 2013}

I arrived in New York last night.  This morning I went in for my job interview.

It was an interesting interview.  We were given poker chips, and throughout the
three different interviews we wagered our chips on probability puzzles.
In the first interview I was placed alongside another interviewee.
Relative to him I did better because he made a couple of betting mistakes.
For the other interviews I was alone.
I definitely wasn't perfect, but I didn't feel too bad about what I did.

As far as the job itself, I left the interview with a much more positive
impression of it than when I went in.  Considering that my teaching job this
quarter has been really hard, by comparison this job seemed cool.  We will see
where the Lord inspires me to go.

I was able to reschedule my interview with BYU for later this month.
This helps take the stress off this weekend.  My flight out of here has been
rescheduled for Sunday night.  I therefore have all day Saturday to do whatever
I want.

\subsection*{February 9, 2013}

This afternoon I took a walk around New York.
It was OK.
I already saw the main highlights of New York on my honeymoon, so there wasn't
anything too fascinating.  Also, the MoMA wasn't great because it had a lot of
bare breasts in the few things I saw before I left.
I also walked around New York in a t-shirt and jeans even though it was
freezing.  I was fine.  For dinner, I went to Lombardi's for highly regarded
New York pizza.  What I got was just OK, not worth what I paid for it.
I am ready to get back home.

In the evening I also Googled Jane Street, the company I interviewed with.
What I found gave me the impression that I didn't get the job.  To be fair,
however, it is being difficult for me to get much information about my ultimate
destiny with respect to the job search.  I felt bad after each phone interview
with Jane Street, yet they flew me out for an interview.  Then when they
invited me, despite my logical conclusion that I should say no to the
interview, I actually felt good about going; that being said, I felt good with
the point of view that I would at least get a free trip to New York and some
interview practice.

In looking at my impressions of each opportunity, I felt distinctly
bad after my in person interview with FICO, and I didn't get that
job.  After the government job, I felt unexpectedly bad, and
circumstances intervened to make me feel bad about that opportunity
as well.  After this interview, I also have the impression that I
didn't get it.  I feel, however, that life will work out for me.  It
is just interesting that I am experiencing so much failure right
now.

\subsection*{February 10, 2013}

I flew home.  It was an exceedingly boring day.  I was grateful to have made it
home safely.

\subsection*{February 11, 2013}

I taught today.  It was adequate.

\subsection*{February 16, 2013}

I spent the morning writing midterms.

In the afternoon we all went to the mall; it was fun to see how much Anna loves
seeing the fountains and going to the play area.  For some reason, when we took
her yesterday, she just wanted to climb onto her stroller.  This time, someone
else had brought an identical stroller, and she went to climb herself on that
person's stroller.  It was funny.

In the evening Allison and I finished the series Numb3rs.  It was a long time
coming, and now we don't have a go to filler show to watch in our spare time.

\subsection*{February 17, 2013}

At church we volunteered in the nursery.
We took Anna to see how she would do.  She is almost 18 months old and is
nearly ready for nursery.  It was a nice time.

\subsection*{February 18, 2013}

I worked on proving a left nullstellensatz for the quaternions.

My mom sent us a package for Valentine's Day, including a gift card to Chili's.
 We went there and had a good meal.  However, at the end Anna became very
fussy.  When we were leaving, we realized that she had a poopy diaper, and
probably had had it for a while.  We felt so bad about it.

\subsection*{February 20, 2013}

Tonight Allison took a pregnancy test and there was a faint blue line on the
pregnant part.  I was in doubt as to what it meant.  We eventually decided to
get a digital test at CVS.  We did that and it came up pregnant.  It was very
surprising because on the days where we were supposed to try having a baby we
were apart in New York and Utah.  It certainly is a blessing to successfully
get pregnant on our first month of trying again, and with the circumstances as
they were.  The hard part is that I don't have a job.

\subsection*{February 21, 2013}

I finally heard back from the financial company I interviewed with and I did not
get a position with them.  It is so frustrating to have had success in
school---in classes I was at the top, and my research has seemingly gone
well---but to not be able to demonstrate that value to prospective employers.

The last thing I have hope for for a job for a while is my interview at BYU.
Circumstances have come together to give me a lot of time to prepare for my
visit.  I feel that my level of preparation for this interview should be above
what I have had at other interviews.  However, I also know that this position
is very competitive, so I don't logically think that I will get it.
That leaves me at the drawing board.  My spiritual impression is that something
will work out, but if I don't get a job from BYU, I am going to have to
re-examine my job search to figure out what I need to add to my resum\'e to
make myself stand out to employers.

\subsection*{February 27, 2013}

I went to Provo this week to interview at BYU.
The interviews were OK and I really left with a good impression of the
university.

I have a good feeling in general about how life will eventually work out.
However, this has been one of the most difficult times in my life.
For one, I have been doing a really bad job at teaching this quarter.
My students seem to have a lot of negative feelings towards me.
Admittedly, I haven't put in the time necessary to give great lectures.

Another thing that is difficult is how I haven't yet found a job.
As I re-approach the job search, I feel depressed, downtrodden, and powerless.
I am uninspired as to where to apply to, how to build up my resume, etc.

\section{}
\subsection*{March 2, 2013}

I am wondering if I will end up in an academic career.
It scares me to think that I may not have success in research.
Research is hard.

I also decided that I like not having the stress of work with me at home.
I like not working.

\subsection*{March 3, 2013}

Church was good.  I fasted.
I need to spend more time with my family, and when I am with my family I need
to give them more of my attention.

\subsection*{March 6, 2013}

I am feeling down about the last exam I gave my students.
I thought it would be easy, but it turned out to be hard.
I also realized that my TA probably has been ``throwing me under the bus'' with
our mutual students.  It is an interesting realization that the TAs have no
loyalty towards me (why would they?).

I am also feeling depressed about my work life in general.
I have been teetering between motivation to do academic work and motivation to
stop and listen for what's coming next.  Today I was light on motivation to do
academic work.

\subsection*{March 7, 2013}

I am stressing out over my math classes, specifically over writing my math
final.

It seems like I have made a lot of mistakes in my teaching this quarter.  One
mistake appears to be that I told the students exactly what the curve was.
That was a mistake since the students realize how hard it is to get a good
grade in Calculus (which is a ``weeder'' class at most any university).

So I am really on edge over writing my final.  I am driven by fear, fear that
my students will hate me and leave bad feedback for one little mistake on an
exam.

\subsection*{March 12, 2013}

I got a call from the government this afternoon, and they informally
offered me a job.  I told them I would have to talk to my wife about
it, but that I am interested.

In the back of my mind, I was wondering about the BYU position.  I
emailed the head of the department and asked what my chances were
(as he told me I should while I was there).  He told me that I was
ranked last out of the three candidates who they had, and that my
chances were low.  The email, however, was nice, and he offered what
little help he had to help me along in my career.  I really have a
positive impression of the BYU math department and of BYU in general
because of my visit there.

On the other hand, I am very humbled by the past few months.  My
experience as a university teacher has been difficult, challenging,
time-consuming, and stressful.  I did not do as well as I thought I
would at the start.  I have learned a lot through the numerous
mistakes I have made.

Further, my academic job search was a total bomb.  My only on-campus
interview was with BYU, and came, to my eye, mostly because I am a
member of the church.  In that interview, I was last place.

However, I consistently felt a spiritual impression that the
academic job search I was going on was ill-fated.  Was it my lack of
preparation?  I believe I was ill prepared.  But was it just my
``destiny'' to not get an academic job?  I believe that for years I
have felt this to be the case; my lack of preparation for an
academic job, I feel, is a by-product of my predetermined course.

Before graduate school, I felt that an academic, intense mathematics
career was not my path.  During graduate school, from a fairly early
time I felt impressions to not attend talks as I had heard that I
ought to do.  I felt that it wasn't necessary to strive to make
connections with my peers.  If I had wanted to be a professor, I did
a horrible job of preparing myself for that.  Instead I had the
blessing of Allison entering my life; in preparation for that, I
learned Spanish.  My life started to shape around family life.  Once
again, I felt that I shouldn't go into academia.  Having a family
and frequently being lost in intense mental struggles with open
mathematics problems seemed incompatible.

When I was originally, tentatively offered a position with the
government, I feared somewhat that I wouldn't be accepted.  And so I
didn't make the first cut of people let in. (Also a humbling
experience.)  It became clear that my advisor expected me to make a
good effort to get an academic position.  Against my inner feelings
I did it.  I started to want to be an academic.  I dreamed of
solving great problems and racking up academic publications.  It
felt like trying out for the Olympics of mathematics.  At the end,
my feelings of hesitation were validated.  I bombed out of the
academic job search.  (That being said, there are still technically
late opportunities to be fought for; I just felt that I ought not
apply for them at this time.)

The non-academic job search was also a failure.  I didn't measure up to what
various companies were looking for.  However, once again I felt that I need not
work on certain skills which non-academic companies were looking for.

At the end of the day, I still have a hard time trusting that the
government job will work out, especially after getting my hopes up
in October/November.

\subsection*{March 14, 2013}

I am still waiting for HR to call from the government.
I want very much to get this job and have my future set.
It has been a hard few months of not knowing what I am going
to do to support my family.
I am still very scared about this job not working out.
However, I can say that I have no real feel for what will happen.

\subsection*{March 15, 2013}

I was finally contacted by the government HR department, and I accepted the job offer
extended me readily.  I am now set to start work on May 20.  We will have the
privilege of having the government move our belongings for us.  The pay will be
at least \$89,000 to start.

This was a great relief to me.
My alternative plans would have been to work for a small salary under my
advisor Dr.\@\xspace Helton here in San Diego while paying increased rent.
Presumably I would have worked on research, applied to any last academic jobs
out there, and seriously looked at what needed to happen for me to get a
non-academic job.  However, I have been doing my best to follow promptings on
what to do with all of that, and I felt that I needed to not worry about
finding a job.  Those promptings are now validated.

I am actually very happy with how things worked out.  I have appreciated the
experience of teaching college classes.  Towards the end, I have started to
enjoy teaching more, and I have become a lot better at it through making a
series of amateur mistakes.  I finally understand how hard teaching is and how
much work one has to put into it. (As a contrast, I did not put that much work
into being a teaching assistant.)  I did not always enjoy teaching---in fact,
sometimes I hated it---but it was a needed experience.

I also understand
another facet of why I wouldn't want to be an academic.
Although it irked me to place last among the candidates for the BYU position,
over the past days I have begun to understand why that would have been a bad
fit for me.  They would have wanted me to teach two classes per quarter; now
that I have come to understand how much work teaching takes, I realize that two
classes is a lot of work.  Further, I would have had to put in a lot of work on
research to forward my career; that's not even to mention that I like research
better than teaching, and my reason for wanting to go into academia would be
to be a successful researcher.  I realized that the hours didn't add up;
really, I would have to work more hours than convenient (or healthy for me?) to
be a success at the BYU postdoc.  On top of that is lower pay and less job
security (I would still be in the midst of a hyper-competitive academic job
market).

I appreciate that the job I currently have waiting for me is excellent in three
ways: (1) work-life balance---it's only 40 hours a week; (2) pay---it's a lot
better than academia; (3) type of work---it appears more mathematical than most
non-academic jobs out there.  I really feel like this job will be a great fit
for me.

\subsection*{March 16, 2013}

We went to Allison's friend Janelle's birthday party, which was nice.  Anna was
into everything at the house we were at---I wonder what it says about her
personality.  In the evening we went through the mall.  We are thinking about
getting a nice laptop soon, seeing that I am getting a job.  Anna is funny at
the mall playground because sometimes she just ignores the play toys and is
more interested in everything on the periphery which isn't a toy.

I am still pretty excited about finally getting a job.
I spent time thinking about how great it is that I will get paid and be able to
have a life outside of work.

\subsection*{March 17, 2013}

It was Anna's first day of nursery.
It was very peaceful to be able to go to Sunday classes and not have to worry
about wrangling her.  At the same time, I knew that nursery would be something
Anna would enjoy, which according to the nursery leader, was the case.  He also
said that she was tough because she took on the biggest boy in the nursery.

\subsection*{March 18, 2013}

My exam for Math 20A turned out to be too hard on one of the problems (at
least).  Oh well.

I have recently been pondering the question of what is more important for
doing well in math, IQ or diligence?

Before this quarter, I had been told about how diligence was much more
important than intelligence in succeeding in mathematics.  Further, I noticed
that I am diligent at mathematics---when I am working on a problem, I don't
give up easily---and I am successful, so it makes sense to me that the two are
correlated.

This quarter, I have realized, however, how natural intelligence is important.
For example, I noticed that out of all of the calculus material, the students
find the story problem sections the hardest.  In a lot of ways, the calculus
content of the story problems done in the introductory calculus class is easier
than the rest of the class.  The hard part, to my eye, is everything which
happens before the calculus takes place.  In essence, the important skill to
have for said problems is the skill of doing story problems, which is an ``IQ
skill''.  The trick, then, is how to teach students story problem skills.  I
will not be continuing on as a teacher, so I don't need to put a lot of time
into solving this problem.  It was an interesting realization to see that
students are struggling with an IQ skill with which I do not struggle, and that
all this time I have not been seeing where the students are really struggling.

I am grateful for being ``good at math''.  In contrast to some of my students,
I never had to work too hard as an undergraduate to get good grades in math.

\subsection*{March 23, 2013}

Here is a recap of some of the things that have happened this week:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The government sent a job offer letter as well as a packet about relocation.
 We have a lot of tough decisions to make on our relocation.  I was also
offered a higher salary due to my previous work experience as a TA/RA.
I am grateful to finally be getting a job and moving on with life.
 \item The Math 20A exam was graded and recorded.  I posted the final scores
for the benefit of my students.  I learned that doing this caused a good number
of students to email me and ask for a slightly higher grade.  I will not tell
my other class their final scores.
 \item The Math 10A test was harder than expected.  Among all of my weaknesses
as a college teacher, not being able to write tests of an appropriate level of
difficulty is one of the biggest.  I am surprised because I thought the
practice test was a lot like the actual test.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{March 27, 2013}

I am struggling to adjust to life
without the huge burden of teaching hanging over me.

I also realized that I should have curved the Math 10A final exam.
In retrospect, the raw scores were too unforgiving.

I have been checking the website ratemyprofessors.com periodically
to see what my students thought of me.  This quarter especially I have only
been getting negative feedback.  I am so grateful to not have to teach again.

\subsection*{March 28, 2013}

I am having trouble being motivated to work on my papers.

Also, I was not meant to be a college teacher.

\subsection*{March 29, 2013}

For some reason, I waited extra long to send an email to notify
BYU that I would not be accepting a position with them.

For one, I guess I was irrationally paranoid about the government job offer falling
through.  Another small part was that I selfishly wanted to find out if I would
have gotten a position at BYU.

However, it was a very weird thing for me to do.
One reason of note for why it was weird was because I have been realizing how
much I do not want to be a college professor, and the BYU job was to be a
college professor.

On the other hand, I suppose there is something in me which gets sheepish in
admitting to other academics that in fact I am going to work outside of
academia.  For one, academia is viewed as the ultimate job by those who are in
academia; that's why they're in it.

Before this year, my plan involved
rejecting academia and finding a normal job.  Then when I had trouble finding a
normal job, I decided to apply for the more competitive academic jobs.  Now I
find that actually I don't have what it takes to get an academic
job.

A side story: A few weeks ago, BYU told me that I had a 5-10\%
chance of getting the job I applied for there.  Then, last weekend they sent me
an email saying my odds increased to 35\%.  At that time I felt embarrassed
to say that I had decided to go in another direction, so I didn't respond.
Then, on Monday, the department head called me directly to check if I had
gotten an email; he then said that they were impressed with me and wanted me to
come; this was a better message, I suppose, than them not wanting me at all,
but I found out from them previously that I was their last choice; then, on
Tuesday, he emailed me to say that my chanced had increased to 60\%.\footnote{I
thought about this some more, and it actually doesn't make sense to me how I
could go from $5-10\%$ to $35\%$ to $60\%$.  If it were just based on
people dropping out, my odds wouldn't change in this way.}
In
some sense, this gave me a self esteem booster because my chances of getting an
academic job ended at over 50\%. On the other hand, my spiritual feelings
throughout the job process have been that I ought not enter academia, so it is
a moot point whether or not I would have gotten a job that I shouldn't have
taken.

\subsection*{April 2, 2013}

Allison spoke in church on Sunday.  I was pleased to hear her speak.
Anna made it through the entire meeting.

My mom and Paul have been in town since Sunday.  I am happy to be able to spend
time with family without worrying about work.

Anna has been babbling a lot lately.  She will start talking and it will sound
like she is speaking a different language.  I was also impressed that when I
asked her to point to a cow and a monkey in a book she was able to do it
without any help.  She is a precious little girl and I am trying to be mindful
that I need to cherish the moments and memories during this free period.

\subsection*{April 4, 2013}

This was my mom and Paul's last full day in San Diego with us.
Anna really has enjoyed having my mom here to play with.

One fun thing this week was going to the beach.  Anna loved standing on the
shore as the water came in and rushed over her feet.  One thing I thought was
great was that one of the days she started bringing sand over and putting it on
me as I was lying down on the beach.

\subsection*{April 6, 2013}

Yesterday, I spent $2 \frac{1}{2}$ hours on campus working on my remaining
papers with my advisor.  I was then to put in some more work and send them back.
Unfortunately, I was not feeling up to it yesterday after I came home from
school.  Further, General Conference was on today, so I didn't ultimately get
it done until the end of today.

General Conference was good, as it usually is.  During this conference, I had
the thought that I should be better.  In my recent life, I have been very
relaxed on a lot of little things.  My best judgment has been for some time
that there are a few habits of mine which I would be better off changing.
Because of the smallness of these habits, and because of my lack of self
control in these recent times, I have not changed said habits.  I decided today
that, for at least the next week, I would marshal up all the self control I
could muster and stop all of these little habits.  My list is the following
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Do not play iPhone games at all.
 \item No headphones; consequently, no podcasts.
 \item Do not bring up eating out. (In the past while I have often suggested we
eat out when there is no dinner.  I should not eat out so much as it is both
unhealthy and expensive.)
 \item Plan out each day.  Make goals.
 \item Wake at 6:30 AM, go to bed at 10:30 PM.
 \item Don't ``surf'' the Internet, specifically don't frequent the usual sites
I waste time on.  I may however catch up on the news once a day.
 \item No ``fun'' until scripture study has been done.  Further, scripture
study should be 30 minutes and should be timed.
 \item Carry out a mission-like morning routine, including
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Exercising, including goals for jogging, push-ups, and sit-ups
  \item Shower
  \item Breakfast
  \item Journal
  \item (and although not mission related) check my bank accounts
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Go to the temple once this week
 \item FHE and family scripture study
\end{enumerate}

 On a blog called {\it Zen Habits}, there have been
posts on goals and on changing bad habits.  Two main things I picked up on were
the following: first, that it is best to change habits one at a time; second,
that it is best to not have a list of goals each day, but perhaps one main
focus of that day.  The list I have formed is in direct opposition to those two
points, as I understand them.
Instead of focusing on one habit, I am choosing
to focus on lots of them at the same time, and in conjunction with this, I will
be making lots of goals and plans.

To me, everything I listed is a
simple fix---that is, all it takes to complete these goals is to put in
effort and strict obedience.  The model to which I previously subscribed is as
follows.  To change a habit, it requires a certain amount of self control.  In
theory, there is only so much self control which I have.  This is why efforts
to change are often unsustainable---I run out of self control.  Therefore, it
is effective to use what self control I have to change one habit at a time;
once a habit has become changed over a sufficient period of time, in theory it
takes little self control to sustain the change.

I now think that this has been an incorrect attitude for causing my own
personal change.  For example, I have at times attempted to change my sleep
habits without changing anything else.  Up until today, I do not have ideal
sleep habits, so obviously my strategy has not worked.  The habits
I have listed stem from giving into carnal impulses; why else would I have
habits which I know are bad.  If I really want to change the way I respond to
temptation, why wouldn't I just always say no to temptation?  It is easier to
be obedient 100\% of the time than it is 99\% of the time.  I feel more
empowered to be eradicating all my bad habits instead of just one. Another thing
is my desire and determination. What is motivating me to change a particular
habit if I am perfectly happy keeping a whole list of other bad habits? Further,
I am blessed with a confidence to believe that whatever I put my mind to I can
accomplish. Therefore, I believe I am strong enough to change all of my bad
habits at once.

As for goals, I have tried making no goals, and frankly I think goals are
helpful for me.

\subsection*{April 7, 2013}

Today was the first full day of doing my ``hardcore week'' goals.
Unfortunately, last week I ate out with my family almost every day, so by
Sunday my stomach was not feeling well.  Combined with me waking at 6:30 AM, I
was feeling pretty sick in the evening.

\subsection*{April 8, 2013}

I am resisting the temptation to cave on my ``hardcore week'' goals.
The only thing was that I chose not to wake early because of my stomach
problems and how weak I felt yesterday before I finally took a small nap.
I figure that sleep is important right now.

In the March Madness bracket, the team I picked to win the championship won the
championship.  What I did was find a website with statistical rankings, and I
literally picked all the games by those rankings.  In my opinion, most casual
fans pick a lot of upsets, so I try not to pick upsets.  Unfortunately, I lost
the tie breaker of the final score of the championship game, so I took $2^{\rm
nd}$ place in the Sullivan family bracket contest.  It was fun though.

\subsection*{April 9, 2013}

Another day trying to keep my ``hardcore week'' goals.
I had some spare time and I washed up the dishes and wiped down the counters of
the kitchen.  Allison came home and was exhausted and beside herself.  After
laying down while I fed Anna her dinner.  Then, she came in while I had put
Anna in her bath and said, ``I'm not going to even worry about the kitchen
tonight.''  I let her know that the kitchen had already been cleaned, and she
was exceedingly grateful.

This experience let me know how much I am going to have to pitch in while
Allison goes through her pregnancy.

\subsection*{April 10, 2013}

I talked in Prof. Helton's class about real left ideals.

I continued my ``hardcore week'' goals.  I need to do better at disconnecting
from leisure activities when Anna is around to spend time with.

\subsection*{April 11, 2013}

We are currently trying to see and do a lot in San Diego before we leave, so
last night we decided to go to tonight's San Diego Padres game.  Unfortunately,
the game was at 7:10, so we did not stay for very much of it, due to Anna.  We
had an overall pleasant time.  We sat on the lawn in the back, had some
(expensive) stadium food, and rolled down a hill.  We also saw a home run.

\subsection*{April 12, 2013}

My ``hardcore week'' goals are progressing adequately.
It took me until the middle of the week to start exercising because of how sick
I felt at the beginning of the week.  Today was the most intense day as I
incorporated short sprints into my jog, just like high school wrestling
practice.  Tomorrow, I would like to also wake up early as part of my
``hardcore week'' goals; that is the other thing I have not done as well
because of how sick I felt at the beginning of the week.  It would be a nice
way to cap this week.

Anna climbed out of her crib during her nap today, much to Allison's utter
shock and amazement.  Earlier that day I saw her boosting herself up on the
walls of the crib, so I wasn't surprised.  She also had a moment where she was
saying, ``ma, ma, ma'', which we thought might have been a call for Allison,
but really she saw her Elmo pajama pants, which she loves.

Also, Anna is scared of the video clip ``Elmo's Ducks'' even though she loves
both Elmo and ducks.

In the afternoon we went to Doyle Park and we had a pleasant time with Anna.

\subsubsection{Pondering}

Today I was thinking about my mindset with respect to being smarter, as smart,
or not as smart as others.  I am realizing more just how intelligent other
people are.  Further, I see how much time and effort people put in in
intelligent ways to rise to the top.

My ``misconceptions'' stem from my first year topology class and from my
research.  In topology, about halfway through the year we started having group
presentations of our homework; I always completed every problem on each problem
set; I soon realized, however, that I was the only one who did this, and it
wasn't even close; that gave me the image that I was doing way better than
everyone else, and that in fact I may be smarter than everyone else, a thing I
hadn't supposed before.\footnote{I wish I had a journal from that time} In
hindsight, I had one killer technique---I studied alone and I didn't give up
until I had solved each problem.

\subsection*{April 13, 2013}

I finished my ``hardcore week''.  I am pleased that I was able to make some
changes that I really felt I needed.  I am also unsatisfied that I could do
better.

For next week, I really want to carry over the momentum of this week.  I
decided to dub this next week ``Hardcore Week part Deux: Hardcore Week Strikes
Back''.  My attitude towards my goals last week was optimism, yet I wasn't so
optimistic that I felt I could replace my habits in the long term.  I very
much want to live a better life, and these goals are a way of doing it.

The big things I want to accomplish is to be physically healthy so I can live
to raise my kids and grow old with my wife, and I want to delete the things
which take my attention away from my family while I have them now.

In the morning, I saw an email for building cleaning at 8 AM.  I went.  I was a
little put off because the people starting it up showed up 10 minutes late.  I
was also not really social with anyone during it.  Further, I didn't have any
of the donuts that were provided because of concerns about my diet.  That being
said, I know that I needed to do the service.

I am also starting a fast today.  For dinner, we went to Subway and had
sandwiches.

\subsection*{April 14, 2013}

I was called yesterday and asked to substitute in Gospel Principles class
today.  Fortunately, I had felt compelled to study the lesson early last
week\footnote{Actually, I see that I received the impression during Priesthood
Session of conference a little over a week ago.  I also received impressions
there to start my ``Hardcore Week'' goals.}, so I was prepared.

I ended my fast today.  It was a hard fast because I also woke early, so the
hunger and tiredness combined to give me a headache.

I have had a hard time filling my Sunday with uplifting activities.  I
eventually caved and read some online articles. I am actually unsure of what a
healthy balance of online digital consumption is for myself.

I have wondered about my job.  I googled what I could find about it.  I wonder
if it will be something I will lock myself into for my career, or if I will
leave at some point and switch careers.  At this point I know that teaching
college students is not for me. (Even though for a moment it seemed that I
might actually get a visiting professorship at BYU.)  I also know that I have
hated the job search, and so a secure job intrigues me.

\subsection*{April 15, 2013}

In the morning it was a little bit easier to wake up at 6:30 AM.  I did a good
morning routine so that I had a good foundation to my day.

I gave another lecture for Prof. Helton's class.  It was good.

I am very anxious about my new job and about everything working out with it.
I still have some fear that somehow everything will fall apart.  I know,
however, that in my career I have been watched over, and that in some way
things will work out for my good.

\subsection*{April 16, 2013}

I didn't have hardly anything work related on my agenda today.
I struggled with what to do with myself.

On the one hand, I know I need to finish my papers before I start work.
However, I also am working with Prof. Helton and Igor Klep to finish them, and
I recently sent them back edits.  Therefore, it is not necessarily efficient to
work on those papers now.

Another consideration is my coming work.  I am very anxious about it.

And then there is the consideration of having family time.
I know that my life is rich inasmuch as I have family time.
However, it is scary to do nothing about the previously mentioned priorities of
mine while I have time.

In the afternoon, we went to a park at Mission Bay.  It was a nice park and
Anna had a good time.

\subsection*{April 17, 2013}

I had a stress dream last night about work.
I dreamt that I did something wrong and screwed up my employment.
I am constantly on edge about securing my work.

I gave a talk in Helton's class today.  I realized I only have three more
possible classes to finish my proof.

We went to Seaport Village.  It was pleasant.  Allison's cousin Neal and his
wife Mary are staying with us for a few days, so they got here today.

\subsection*{April 18, 2013}

We went to the beach today.  It was fun.

I am still doing fairly well at keeping my goals.  However, I am realizing how
much desire plays into keeping goals.  I need to really want to keep my goals
in order to keep them.

\subsection*{April 19, 2013}

We went to Anna's checkup this morning.  She is a healthy baby.
Her height, weight, and head circumference were all around the $90^{\rm th}$
percentile.  She has been having a little bit of a hard time because of a runny
nose.  She woke up in the middle of the night last night crying because of it.
Also, this afternoon she woke up from a nap with her leg caught in the crib
slats.  I had to work hard for about 20 seconds to get it unstuck.

We spent most of the day following the news.  There was a massive manhunt for
the Boston Marathon bombers.

\subsection*{April 20, 2013}

Our San Diego thing of the day was a meal at El Indio.  It was good.

Allison left for a few hours to visit with her old work friends.  It was a
little bit boring because I didn't really have work to do and I don't really
have fulfilling hobbies to fill my time.

\subsection*{April 21, 2013}

Church was good.  Anna said ``mom'' for the first time I can remember her ever
undeniably saying it, which warmed Allison's heart.  She seemed to have had a
good time in nursery, although she was wet from ostensibly spilling water on
herself.  The classes were good and touched on two topics I have been thinking
about lately: following leaders and keeping goals.

We had out home teachers John and Nate over for probably the last time.  I was
grateful to have had good home teachers in this ward.  I thoroughly enjoyed
every visit they made, and we were able to call on them from time to time to
help us.  I also probably wouldn't have made friends with them without having
them as home teachers, so I was grateful for that too.

I am starting to realize how sad it will be to leave San Diego.  It is starting
to sink in that I am currently doing certain things for the last time.
Further, the last day is coming soon, and I started to realize how sad it will
be to leave this place that I have lived in for the past almost 6 years.
Allison, of course, is taking it harder than I am, so I will have to be a
little bit strong for her.  I suppose it is just a condition of this life that
nothing here on earth lasts forever, for good and for bad.

I am remembering tonight the time I spent in Single Graduate Housing.  I
remember walking to the grocery store before I had a car, and carrying home two
gallons of milk.  I remember the jogs I would go on.  I remember lonely times
when I would be at Ralphs listening to headphones and just enjoying wandering
around.  I am moved by those introspective moments in my life.

I am also
remembering similar moments I had at Utah State.  I remember the nights
jogging, listening to music.  For some reason those times are the most
memorable.  There must have been something comforting about being by myself
engulfed in endorphins.  I also remember girls who were probably interested in
me, but I was oblivious.  That's a moot point, however, because I already have
the love of my life.  It's just one of those things where I believe the proper
way to act was probably different from the way I acted, but the end result of
me having my wife is the end result I would choose again and again.

\subsection*{April 22, 2013}

The past couple days I have had a clogged nose, a sometimes headache and an
almost sore throat.  Despite it, I stuck to my goal and woke at 6:30 AM.
Further, I have been doing my best to stay away from unhealthy snacks.

In the morning Allison went to her pregnancy appointment while I stayed home
and watched Anna.  Anna is at a funny stage in her development where she does
so many funny things, including play acting with her baby doll and her plastic
cell phone.

I talked again in Prof.\ Helton's class.  It looks like Wednesday will be the
last time I see him; I am very grateful for all of the support he has given me
over my nearly six years in San Diego; he has been indispensable.

For family home evening, we went to the park for a bit; for our lesson we
watched part of the Worldwide Training meant for the family.

\subsection*{April 23, 2013}

To start off the day, one of the best moments happened as I was changing Anna's
diaper.  I pointed to Mickey Mouse and asked her who it was.  For some reason,
she decided to turn, point to Allison, and distinctly say, ``mom.''  I was very
pleased with that.

At any rate, today we went to Disneyland for the last time as residents of
Southern California.  It was great.  We were able to see many characters who
Anna knew.  Early in our day, we got to see a show where some characters danced
to the Disneyland band.  During that, Donald Duck came and danced with Anna.
He also gave her a kiss with his duck beak.  At one point, Anna quacked at him.
 We also saw Mickey a few times throughout the day.  Anna honked his nose,
gave him five, and blew him a kiss.  Mickey's image was everywhere, and she
pointed to him several times and said, ``dede'' (Mickey in Anna-speak.) I
insisted on planning out before what we would do, and at least for me it helped.
 We ate good meals there and in general had a better hold on how to do
Disneyland with a toddler.  I was very glad to go and enjoyed it greatly.

\subsection*{April 25, 2013}

Last night I was doing revisions on one of the papers Prof.\ Helton and his
colleague Igor Klep have been polishing with me, and I found that one of my
small results had a completely incorrect proof.  I spent a lot of last night
and a good chunk of today on it, and I got nowhere.  I might just have to throw
in the towel on this one because I am too busy with life.

Allison started getting some spotting.  We were concerned because it is
possibly a sign of miscarriage.  I gave her a blessing last night.  However,
when she called and was able to talk to a nurse, she said that some bleeding is
normal; further, it is likely from the information given that her grueling day
at Disneyland caused it.

For dinner we went to our final Phil's BBQ.  I got the full rib dinner, which
was an expensive meal: essentially double the amount of ribs I usually order.
It was delicious (but no doubt bad for me).

\subsection*{April 26, 2013}

Today I went to a temple session, presumably my last one at the San Diego
Temple.  It caused me to remember when I was called to be an ordinance worker
in the temple.

It was my first year in graduate school, and out of the blue I
received a phone call to come to the temple for an interview.  I didn't have a
car in those days, so the secretary gave me the name of a brother in my ward
who was also being interviewed; I called him and he gave me a ride.  In the
interview, I was asked to serve as an ordinance worker for at least two years.
At the time, my initial reaction was hesitation.  I
was currently enjoying my Saturdays and was using them, in part, to do school
work.  However, it is ingrained in my mind that when a church leader extends a
call, you take it.  I therefore accepted the call because I trusted in that
principle. I figured it had to be Saturday, and I didn't want to wake early, so
I signed up for Saturday mid-day.

I remember those first weeks I walked to the temple because I couldn't find a
regular ride and because the bus system wouldn't get me there any more
conveniently.  Within the first weeks, I also broke up with the girl who I had
been dating, a decision I am grateful for.

Working there, I gained a lot of leadership experience, and I felt it boost my
confidence.

The ultimate blessing I had there was that it was through my calling that I met
my wife Allison.

Unfortunately, for me it had a little bit of a bitter ending.  I was on the
Spanish shift, overwhelmed as an assistant coordinator.  Our coordinator had to
leave, and when he was replaced, I was also replaced as an assistant
coordinator.  As a regular worker on the Spanish shift, there was not much for
me to do; the point of the Spanish shift, it turned out, was to train Mexican
ordinance workers, so often I wouldn't have to do much in deference to them.

Then, Allison and I decided that Saturday mornings were a big sacrifice given
her busy schedule, and so we switched to Tuesday night.  It was a relief
because of how things were going on the previous shift.  However, I was not
ready to be thrown into a new social situation.  Further, as the Tuesday night
shift was well staffed, there was still not much to do.  Finally, as I did not
have the trust of the old timers on the shift---they did not know me---I was
treated more like a new worker than an experienced one.  It was not enjoyable.
After a few months, given my busy schedule and my lack of enjoyment, I decided
to quit for good.

I hate that my temple experience ended on such a low note.  I suppose it is one
of those things in life to overcome and learn from.

As for the rest of the day, I got the oil changed in the Green Machine.  Dave
and Gina came over for games; unfortunately Gina has been having some health
problems and was faint at the end of the night; also, Dave lost his great job
at UC Davis at the end of his six-month probationary period because they didn't
think he was a good fit; sad stories all around.

\subsection*{April 27, 2013}

I went to clean the church in the morning while Allison helped out with
watching kids at the Helping Hands service project.

In the late afternoon we went to spend time with Allison's friends Brianne and
Janelle and their families.  It still seems like we can't actually be moving.
I am still very skeptical that the new job will work out.\footnote{Allison
reminded me that I need to look towards the future with faith.  I think I have
had weak faith throughout my job search.}

We bought some small water bottles the other day from Target.  All day, Anna
was carrying water bottles from one location to another (and usually back
again).  She has been described lately by people who have watched her as
``busy''.

\subsection*{April 28, 2013}

Today was our last Sunday of church in San Diego.  Incidentally, every day
lately has been a last something in San Diego.

Anna had a good time in nursery.  I am happy for such a happy baby.  She has
also become obsessed with carrying around water bottles---she did it all day
today as well.

I had my last home teaching visit in the ward.  I am grateful for my home
teaching companion, but in my new ward I want to be a great home teacher.

We had dinner with the Diehl's (Allison's visiting teacher's family).  They
were kind to do that for us.

In the evening we packed up things we want to take with us on the road.  It is
starting to get real that we are moving.

\subsection*{April 29, 2013}

The movers came in the morning.  They were able to pack and load our whole
house by 1:30.  It was so convenient.

I walked to UCSD to return my office key.  It was my final time at UCSD before
moving.  I was not nostalgic.  I have come to realize that my greatest joys
in San Diego were not had on campus at UCSD.  In fact, I was reading an old
journal I found, and I saw that my thoughts were much more devoted towards
church and towards my social life.  In the end, my greatest friends here are
Allison and Anna, and I get to take them with me.

It is odd having an empty apartment.  We had a funny moment where we were all
running around the empty rooms.  Anna laughed so much at this.

We had dinner at the Rockwoods.  It was very nice of them to have us over.
They also were kind enough to lend us some things which we needed for tonight.

\subsection*{April 30, 2013}

Such a bittersweet day---our final day in San Diego.

I woke early and exercised.  I am grateful for the impetus I received to start
a habit of running this month.  We spent the morning finishing cleaning and
then packing our stuff in our cars.  At the end, as Allison was vacuuming, I
took Anna outside to walk around.  We passed by a small dog figure that someone
has outside their door; Anna always likes to sit by it and touch its nose.  I
told Anna to say goodbye to it, so she walked up to it and said bye.  It
reminded me of the great memories we had in just the five short months we lived
in our apartment.  I did not feel as sad to leave as I did our One Miramar
Street apartment, but it still was sad to leave behind memories.

After turning in our keys, we had an early lunch with Allison's old work friend
Frannie.  At the end, they hugged and shed some tears.  We then made our drive
away from San Diego for the last time.  It was sad to me to see things which
had become all so familiar to me knowing that I would be seeing them for the
last time.

We drove in separate cars northward because we have two cars and are (probably)
planning on leaving a car in St.\ George.  It was OK, but we could probably
plan better to accommodate Anna's needs.

During the drive I had time to ponder.  (1) I realized that Allison moved to
San Diego to live, unlike me; I moved to San Diego to go to school, nothing
more; it put into context how different our perspectives are; I am beginning to
realize more just how hard this is for her.  (2) I realized that school was not
my life but just something I took care of in between living life; I realized
that I had a successful life in San Diego because I found my wife and started a
family; I have so much happiness in my home; I also graduated from school and
got a decent enough job; whether or not my school career lived up to my
potential is therefore irrelevant; I was richly blessed in San Diego.

We arrived in Las Vegas in the late
afternoon.  We had reserved a hotel for the night in Las Vegas.  It turned out
to be shady looking---in Allison's opinion, not mine necessarily---but we are
staying here any way.  We went to the Bellagio and looked at the fountain show
and the artwork.  We ate at a mall across the street; the place was called
Fresh but we did not find it to be so healthy or desirable.

Tomorrow we head to St.\ George.

\section{}

\subsection*{May 1, 2013}

Near the start of the day, Allison found a large cricket on her bed after she
was already up. At her insistence we left as soon as possible. We did, however,
still stay for free Denny's.  As a result, we worked this afternoon to cancel
all of our future Days Inn stays in favor of Holiday Inn. We will actually have
a more efficient route this way also.

We were received well in St.\ George.

Hopefully I can get whatever it is I need to have a good productive day
tomorrow.

\subsection*{May 2, 2013}

We spent some time today visiting all of Anna's cousins.

I got a lot done on revising my matrix nullstellensatz paper.  I will probably
be submitting it soon.  It was not fun to revise.

I am struggling with my food consumption.
A couple days ago, after reading in a book I am reading about overeating,
I decided to not snack at all and only eat three meals a day.
During said meals, I am being tempted to eat a lot, which I did at least during
my lunch,  Further, I feel that most of the options presented to me are less
diet friendly than I would like.  I felt I did better during dinner in settling
for a more modest portion size.  The social pressure of being in a family
eating setting is being really hard on me, however.

\subsection*{May 3, 2013}

We took care of a few errands and visited with Allison's grandma.

I am in a conundrum with my eating.  I feel that I have been overeating so much
that it is hard for me to feel truly hungry anymore, even after not eating that
much.  I feel like I have a lot of meals which I could be skipping and still be
healthy.

\subsection*{May 4, 2013}

We had our cars checked out. My Green Machine has a lot of little things wrong
with it, many of them my fault. Allison's Champagne Supernova is in great
condition. It is a good thing that I haven't driven Allison's car extensively so
that it is still in good shape.  Also Allison had been driving Green Machine
mostly, so all of the miles are on it.

In the afternoon we went to the Crazy Duck Park. It was adequate. We had pizza.

I am starting a fast. The purpose of the fast is to feel closer to the Lord. For
some reason, during last month when I was doing so well at knocking out goals, I
didn't feel as spiritual as I would have expected. I would have again prayed for
the job, but I don't really know what more I can pray about the job.

This evening I was very grumpy. Part of it was hunger, part of it was probably
social exhaustion from being around everyone for a few hours while super hungry.
I snapped at Allison.

\subsection*{May 5, 2013}

We had church at 9 AM in the morning. We were pleased because Anna was able to
get a nap at her normal time. Also, Anna loved nursery, as she always did.

I was doing a fast which ended at dinner time, so I skipped the traditional
Sunday after-church chips and salsa.

After my fast, I felt like I was in "starvation mode" so I had a splurge on
sweets. It made me feel a little sick. Also, my appetite for junk food was
diminished after not eating it for a while.

\subsection*{May 6, 2013}

We took off from St.\ George to Springville in the morning. We left the Green
Machine there to be sold.

We had a fun time with our afternoon in Springville.

\subsection*{May 7, 2013}

We had a chill day. We played a lot of spades.

\subsection*{May 8, 2013}

Today we hung out in Springville, and we didn't go out to eat at all. We played
a lot of spades.

\subsection*{May 9, 2013}

It was our last day in Springville. It was sad to leave my family. It felt like
there was some kind of finality to it all even though in theory we will be back
often.

I am still worried about the transcripts thing. I will call on it tomorrow.

In the evening we drove to Evanston. The drive wasn't so bad. Our hotel room is
nice—large room, king bed, jacuzzi in the room, and a nice set of amenities.

\subsection*{May 10, 2013}

We drove from Evanston to Cheyenne—basically from one end of Wyoming to the
other. Wyoming is basically all rolling hills. We ate lunch at Cafe Rio, only
the Wyoming location didn't have fideos on Friday, much to Allison's chagrin. We
got to Cheyenne at about 4:15 in the afternoon. Before bedtime, we took Anna to
the hotel pool. She loved it. She was really tired at the end of the day and
fell asleep quickly.

I called in the morning about my transcripts. It turned out that my recruiter
had not received the transcripts I mailed. It apparently had gotten to someone
else who opened it. Fortunately I was able to get her to still take that. I now
need to (re-)send my USU transcript.

We were accepted for a townhouse in Maryland. We will be signing the lease
before we get there. We will also have our things moved in the day after we
arrive. Allison, in particular, is very excited.

\subsection*{May 11, 2013}

We drove from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Grand Island, Nebraska. We stopped halfway
in between for lunch. Our hotel is in the middle of a really small town. Really
our whole trip has been through sparsely populated rural areas. At the hotel we
swam which Anna once again loved. Anna has been tired on this trip, so I am
trying to do my part to be extra accomodating of her needs.

\subsection*{May 12, 2013}

We left from Grand Island, NE, to go to church in the ward of Allison's friend
Melissa.  We had a nice drive through the small towns and farm land of
Nebraska.  After church we visited her and her family's house, just outside of
Omaha.  It seems like a nice set up they have there; living in Omaha didn't
seem bad at all.  After that, we drove to Coralville, Iowa.  In between, in Des
Moines, we had Hardees, which is a bizarro Carl's Jr.  Also, I left my laptop
in Cheyenne but it looks like they will mail it to me.

\subsection*{May 13, 2013}

We went from Coralville, Iowa, to Fremont, Indiana. We drove through Illinois as
well. We had lunch at Culvers in Illinois and were mostly disappointed in the
food. Allison was pulled over in Illinois for not signaling to change lanes, but
was not given a ticket. I was glad to leave Illinois. Our hotel was adequate.

\subsection*{May 14, 2013}

I drove the whole way from Fremont, Indiana, to Somerset, Pennsylvania. We
stopped once at a travel plaza in Ohio. I was glad to do all the driving.
Pennsylvania was surprisingly beautiful. Our hotel was good.

\subsection*{May 15, 2013}

We made the three hour journey from Somerset, Pennsylvania, to our new
neighborhood in Maryland. We stopped at the credit union for some certified
checks. We went to McDonalds breakfast for our first meal in Maryland. We passed
by our new church to be. We then waited by our new home to be. We signed the
lease. Our road trip officially ended with us bringing everything in from the
car.

Our new place is a three-story townhouse. It is \$1650 per month, which seems
like a good deal. We are going to have a lot more space than we are used to.
There are some little things around the house which are annoying, but I am still
pleased to be here.

We went to Costco after Anna's nap. We got a lot of groceries, seeing that we
have none. For dinner we went to KFC. I need to start eating healthier once we
get settled. We visited the grocery store by our house, Weis. Around 7 we put
Anna to bed. We don't have Internet until Friday and we slept on the floor of
our new place.

Allison had a hard time with the move today. We both miss San Diego. For me, it
is odd to identify myself with Maryland and not with San Diego, or at least some
other western location. Allison, for her part, did a better job than I did of
making friends, so she is having a rougher time here away from people she knows
and loves. She was caught off guard by how everything seems different here. They
don't even sell our favorite cheese brand, Tilamook. Hopefully things will
improve.

\subsection*{May 16, 2013}

The movers came this morning and unloaded our things. We still have to sort
through all the boxes of miscellaneous items and put them where we would like
them to go.

I continue having a feeling of hopelessness when it comes to this new job. To be
fair, I have had some misgivings about every job. It feels like if I don't like
my job, or if I lose my job, then I am in a hopeless situation where I can't
possibly change jobs. I do know that it is a big expense to move, and it has
taken a lot effort not only on my part but on the part of Allison, and even
Anna, to move out here.

It also feels like that in my job I will be stuck. I will be plugging away at my
measly job earning my mediocre salary.

I don't yet know if my fearful feelings are self-made or if they're a part of a
bigger picture. It is also distressing to feel uneasy about my job seeing that I
know (1) I felt legitimately bad about academia and (2) I know very well that
academia is not an option for me.

In the afternoon, Allison's old friend from San Diego, Kim, came over and helped
unpack some things. It was a needed bit of excitement for unpacking.

\subsection*{May 25, 2013}

I was thrown off by (1) the cross country drive, (2) the (temporary) loss of my
laptop, and (3) my new job.

My new job started this week.  I have been attending a general new employee
orientation.  It is OK.  I am glad to be in a job right now and getting paid
for it.

We have been doing the budget recently.  Before we sat down and did it, I think
we both assumed that since I was going from ``making a little'' to ``making a
lot'' that we would have no problems.  The actual numbers, however, are tighter
than I had anticipated.  First, there are things which come out every month
which are fixed.  After those, we are left with about \$1,800 per month. Part
of the things which come out, unfortunately, is a \$400 student loan minimum
payment.  Next, with the \$1,800, one needs to look at how much we can
reasonably spend on various categories: if I drive to work, gas will be big;
food is big; utilities are going to be big here; incidentals will be big with a
baby and another baby on the way; entertainment will be something.  Then are
things we want to do this year: travel to Utah; give gifts.  Further, we need
to set aside money for car repairs.  With reasonable estimates for each of
those categories, we conclude with an excess of \$475.

What is the problem?  We had planned to get a new car when we came, presumably
a nice one.  We also have to pay off our student loans and build up our
emergency fund.  We do not have money to do all those things really.  We
therefore are going to try to make it work with one car only.  It will be tough.

\subsection*{May 26, 2013}

We went to church today.  I am having a hard time identifying myself with those
in my ward.  I feel like I will need to work hard at bridging this gap.

I thought on my teaching career.  I learned a lot from it, but as I was
learning, I mostly did a bad job.

\subsection*{May 27, 2013}

In the morning we went to Patapsco State Park.  We met up with some of
Allison's friends.  We were going to do a hike, but it got too close to nap
time, and Allison is also out of shape for a hike.

I am concerned about being too bored.  Now that I have gone for this job, which
is 40 hours per week and nothing more, I have a ton of time to fill.  In the
past, I have filled it with some combination of time wasting (Internet, phone
games, etc.) or ``work''.  I have no ``work'' to fill my time with, and I am
(unsuccessfully) trying not to waste time.

\subsection*{May 28, 2013}

Work was fine.  I was a little tired today.

I came home and had some quality time with my family.

\subsection*{May 29, 2013}

Work was adequate.

\section{}

\subsection*{June 3, 2013}

Today was the last day of orientation.
I am glad to be done with it.
I am worn out from it; it was a lot of sitting and listening
and then a lot of reading boring government material.

We had a discussion about getting another car.
I am starting to want to get another one.

\subsection*{June 7, 2013}

At work, from Tuesday on, I have been in ``base camp''.  How work will function
is that for the next three years I will be in the development program.  During
the development program, I will do 6-9 month ``internships'' at various offices
within the organization.  During each internship, I will learn a different part
of what goes on.  I will learn computer skills; compared to most
mathematicians, my computer programing background is really weak.  Sometimes, I
will not be doing something so mathematical; sometimes I will.

During our
program, we will also pause to take math courses.
It turns out that to do some of my internships, it will be helpful to have
already taken some of these courses.  Therefore, of necessity I will go for an
internship which is very beginner friendly.

Over the past week we---my fellow newbies and I---have been going on
interviews for each of these positions.  The interviews are not like job
interviews.  We have jobs and will be payed no matter what.  Further, we are
funded by the development program, so it only helps the offices in which we
would like to work to have us work there.  Finally, because of budget, there
are a lot of open spots for interns.  Therefore, mostly we will pick what we
want to do.

We have gone on four interviews so far.  There was one place in which I felt
most comfortable; out of the descriptions, it was actually the one that seemed
least likely to be picked by me, but it had a good vibe.  One of the ones I
would have wanted, by contrast, had a much worse vibe.

It is still odd to be three weeks into the job and not really working.  I am
going to take next week and go on more interviews, learn about the
organization more, and dedicate my time to learning things.

I have also been giving one of my fellow newbies, Andy, a ride to and from work
every day.  It has been a bit restrictive because (a) I like to jam out in the
car and (b) I like the freedom of coming and going as I please without
answering to anyone.  It is good for me, probably, to make connections with
others.

\subsection*{June 8, 2013}

Saturday we didn't have much planned.
In the evening, I ended up getting us to go to Mission BBQ.
It was not as good as Phil's BBQ in San Diego, but it was good enough for us to
probably go back.

\subsection*{June 9, 2013}

We got new callings: nursery leaders.  I was pleased.  I am glad to not have to
be a ward missionary.  It was a hard calling for a few reasons; mostly, it was
hard to know what to do to fulfill the calling.

\subsection*{June 10, 2013}

We went to the ultrasound today.  We shouldn't have brought Anna because it
took all of my attention away from the new baby.  We found out we were having
another girl, which wasn't surprising.  We were both pleased with the outcome.

A big chunk of the work day was taken up with a tour interview, which ended up
being long and boring.  None of us was interested in that opportunity.

\subsection*{June 11, 2013}

We had three tour interviews today.  I am wavering on what I want to do for my
first tour.

\subsection*{June 12, 2013}

Work was less hectic today.  We stayed in one spot the whole day and worked on
independently studying computer programming.

I decided on my first tour.  I was guided mostly by my spiritual impressions.
The tour is the friendliest office we visited.  One of my fellow newcommers is
also going to that office, which in a way is a deterrent because I want
to do my own thing. This opportunity sounds like the easiest internship I would
have.  There is some concern that it could get boring.  However, I had to stay
true to my impressions.

\subsection*{June 13, 2013}

I spent all day at work on one computer exercise. I feel that I learned a lot,
but I sure looked ridiculous compared to my colleagues who are better
programmers.

\subsection*{June 14, 2013}

Work was our last day before going to our internships on Monday.
For dinner we went to Pachanga grill; I thought it was good, but it was pricey
for what we got.

\subsection*{June 15, 2013}

Saturday:
We went shopping at Target and took long naps in the afternoon.

\subsection*{June 16, 2013}

At church, Anna was very well behaved in sacrament meeting.
For the other two hours, we had our first day in nursery.  I think it went
well. (Anna is in junior nursery; we are in senior nursery.)

\subsection*{June 17, 2013}

First day of my tour.  There was setting up of accounts and things to do.
Email still doesn't work properly.  Other than that, it was worky.  I didn't
feel much of a sense of accomplishment from today.

\subsection*{June 18, 2013}

I was tired and fell asleep all of the sudden last night.
I woke up this morning around 5.  I went into work around 7.
I forgot my lunch.  I then decided to do 9 hours today.
I was tired at the end of the day.  I also felt a general sense of discomfort.

\subsection*{June 19, 2013}

Today at work was better.  Email and computer sound were finally resolved.

\subsection*{June 20, 2013}

I forgot my lunch again.  I was pretty hungry at work.  I wore down as the day
went on.

\subsection*{June 23, 2013}

I have been worried about our finances this weekend.

We somehow went to an ultrasound place that was not a preferred
provider for our insurance.  We are most likely going to be on the
hook for the full amount: about \$1000.  We were quite upset about
it.  This caused me to be even more mindful about the rest of our
budget.  This month we are going to run a deficit.  In future
months, we will have to really have conservative spending in order
to keep our budget in the black.  And even doing that, we will be
building our emergency fund very slowly and paying down our debt
very slowly.

I am trying to keep faithful about it all.  I know that we are saving about
10\% of our money (including the matching dollars) in our retirement fund.  We
are paying another 3\% towards a pension.  Therefore, we are saving quite a lot
for our distant future.

\subsection*{June 29, 2013}

This evening we went to a barbeque at the house of a family in my development
program.  Before we left, I realized that I had left the address to the house
in my office.  I tried to go into work to get it, but the buildings were locked.
For future reference, I will not try to go into work on a Saturday without
complete assurance that I will be able to enter the building.  We turned back
home, but Allison insisted that we try to look up the contact information on
the Internet.  We said a prayer, and then Allison tried to find the information.
We somehow found the address and made it there.  In fact, even though I thought
we would be late, we ended up being the first ones to show up.
I was glad to have been able to make social contacts with people from work.
ALso, Anna razzled and dazzled as usual.

\subsection*{June 30, 2013}

This week at work was adequate.  Last week I finished the book on Perl.
This was probably pretty fast.  This week I learned even more.  I dissected a
script which printed out was about 30 pages long.  It felt like it might have
been a little bit of a waste of time, however, and it was really tedious.  At
the end of the week, I wrote a script to handle a tedious task among my three
or so tedious tasks I have.  It took maybe an hour to write this script---I
justified the time as learning Perl---and as a result it significantly
decreased the time it takes me to do said tedious task.  I am planning this
next week to write scripts for all the tedious tasks I have so that I will be
able to have more time for other things.

I am glad that I picked the tour I picked because I was able to have another
intern I went in with named Tim in the same office.  It has been good to have a
a friend at work.  It does seem that there is a danger that this office is
going to be boring work-wise based on word of mouth and based on the first two
weeks.  I do take comfort knowing I only am obligated to 6 months, which
includes 6 weeks of a class, and I know that I will come out of it having
learned a lot.

I am glad that I got my job.  It seems like it was somewhat competitive to get
the job this year, and it seems that in the future they will hire even less
people.  I was glad to have had the learning experience of being a professor
for two quarters, even though ultimately I do not like teaching college.
I am also acutely aware that I barely got the job; I also did not get a single
job offer apart from this one, which fact is truly humbling.

\section{}

\subsection*{July 3, 2013}

This evening we went to an Independence Day celebration at Ft.\ Meade---that
is, we went to an hour of it before we pooped out.

Anna last night decided that she didn't want to go to sleep.  She also
discovered that she is tall enough that it is easy for her to climb out of her
crib.  She climbed out several times.  Tonight we just closed the door, got her
extra tired, but we still found her asleep on the floor with her Dolly.

\subsubsection*{Learning and Work}

I have a lot of confidence in my ability to learn quickly.  I started my job
with full confidence that I would pick up anything that was thrown at me, and
that I would do so easily. It appears that I probably need to qualify that
assessment a little bit.  I find that I do best when I can get hands on with
something.  For example, I whizzed through the Perl book in the first week
because I was able to get hands on with the examples.  On the other hand, there
has been a lot of information which has been thrown my way which has been hard
to grasp.  I need to get hands on with things which are being thrown at me.

I feel, however, as I near the end of my third week, that I am starting to make
some progress on understanding things.  I have been able to get hands on with a
small number of things so far.  The biggest item remaining for me is a project
which my tour mentor Katie said I would be working on; she told me the project
the first day, but I still haven't actually gotten started on it.  Tomorrow at
work, I am going to tackle a project, similar but easier than the one I am
to finish; I plan on blocking out a large chunk of the day for this project and
hope to get at least a rough draft version completed.

I haven't been bringing home any of my ``work'', but I have been bringing home
Perl problems.  I need to stop it.  I can't let this get in the way of my
relationship with my wife.

I do feel a compulsion to work as hard as possible at work.  Part of it is
probably my personality.  I feel part of it is that I am acutely aware that I
didn't get offered a job until after a bunch of people, so I feel I have a lot
to prove; further, I didn't get offered any other jobs, so once again, I feel I
have a lot to prove.

\subsection*{July 4, 2013}

We got Anna a toddler bed.  It is plain white.  My mom was generous enough to
offer to pay for it.  Since I had had so much practice putting together cribs,
it wasn't that hard to put together the bed.  We got Anna a Minnie Mouse set of
sheets to go with it.  To make things more difficult, we also decided to take
away her binky tonight, so she had a rough time with that.  She didn't fall
asleep until after 10 PM.

\subsection*{July 5, 2013}

My intentions at work today were to start and finish a project which is---at
least in a simplified telling---a baby version of the project I was assigned to
do at the beginning of my tenure in the office.  I made some progress, but what
I found is that it was hard.  There are just a lot of things I didn't
understand yet.  I am going to have to try to get over my reluctance to ask for
help.  I thought, for better or worse, that my office was going to be easy; for
some reason, I have now found myself tackling hard---at least hard for
me---projects.

\subsection*{July 6, 2013}

We had a nice day together as a family.  We went to BBQ, had ice cream, and
went swimming.  Anna is still adjusting to her bed.

\subsection*{July 9, 2013}

I have been going into work at about 6 AM every day.  When I started doing this
I was enjoying getting off of work at 2:30 PM.  I seem to have energy before
lunch, and it is relieving to not have to do much after lunch ended at 12:30.
It is also nice when I can be home early so that Allison doesn't get so bored.
However, I have had a lot of problems getting to bed at 9 PM so that I can
reasonably wake up at 6.  Further, I don't have time in the morning to exercise
and to study my scriptures; I have had to study my scriptures at the end of the
day when I am tired, and I have not exercised at all.  Today, I was so tired at
work, I felt like I was getting sick.

Fortunately, work was basically fine.  I had a couple of talks to go to today.
My work so far seems adequate.  I started thinking more and more about what my
next tour is going to be (even though I am still 5-6 months away from being
able to start a new tour).  I feel like I am more or less ready to start my
main project, and from what I can see, I might be able to finish it in the next
couple of weeks.

We went on a walk with Anna to a place next to a duck and goose pond.  It was
nice.  In the future, I need to appreciate what little time I have with my
family.

\subsection*{June 10, 2013}

Work today was worky.  I was given another thing to do at work, and I think it
was explained to me how to do something similar a few weeks ago, but I
completely forgot.  I am going to have to figure out some way to find another
explanation for it.  Most of my day was spent revising a piece of code which I
have been working on.  It reminded me of revising papers I wrote.  I definitely
could feel how the experience of revising my papers helped me out on that
project.  Further, I could see how my tendency to not be as thorough as
possible haunts me even in this job.

\subsection*{June 11, 2013}

Work today was worky. I got to work around 6:30, which is about a half an hour
later than usual.  My parking was marginally worse than usual---that is, my
parking was still pretty good. I spent a lot of time on a small Perl thing.  I worked on
it for a chunk of time at home as well.  I found out that there was a very
simple fix that I didn't realize (or even learn about?).  I simply had to add a
letter to what I had been doing.

Today was 7/11 day.  7/11's were giving away free small slurpees so we all went
there.

\subsection*{June 12, 2013}
I had a rough day at work.  For at least a week I have been working on a piece
of code.  The junior permanent member of the team offered to supervise my work.
I soon saw that she was excited to be the "senior analyst" over me as she had
never had such an opportunity.  I was OK with that, and given the project I
needed someone to explain the particulars of the proprietary packages my work
uses.  I knocked out my rough draft of the code in about two days and handed it
off to her to look over.  She pointed out a bunch of things which were
reasonable, including a lot of things I had doubts about. The last few days have
been a series of revisions and notes from her.  This is where things have gotten
rough.

There was one piece of code in my first draft which she said was not "perly"
enough. It was something which I had struggled to do elegantly, and the only
thing which worked was to do it the inelegant way.  I gave up on doing it
elegantly the first time and moved on.  I asked her what could be done to make
it "perlier".  She didn't know actually, but eventually she said that the
reviewers---there are reviewers who review these kinds of code so that they can
be approved for production use---like when one uses regular expressions.  I had
used regular expressions in my inelegant version, and through later
conversations I realized that she didn't see that I had used regular
expressions.  By the time it got down to yesterday, she recommended something of
the flavor which I had tried but failed.  I tried again to implement it, but it
didn't work.  I was very frustrated with it, so I went home and researched it.
After much searching, I found a couple things which were fundamentally wrong
with what I was doing.  I thought I had it perfect and that I showed her what
was what.  This morning I sent her my notes of what had been done.  She
responded by saying that her version of things worked and that she would show me
why mine didn't.  I went over to see, and it seemed like her code ran perfectly.
I was very upset by this because there were several things in her code which I
tried which failed for me.  In hindsight, I am incredulous.  I researched even
more tonight and found clear places where people talk about how the things she
suggested (and which somehow worked!) do not work.  I am leaning towards
believing that something was not as it seemed when she showed me it worked.
(Perhaps the version of the code she ran did not match up to what she was seeing
in her directory?)

I guess the hard time I am having can be summed up as she didn't seem to
know any more than I did with the specifics of this problem but she was
condescending in telling me how to solve the problem, except it didn't work the
way she said. (Not to mention that I had previously thought of the same exact
strategy as her.)

But really I have to rise above throwing myself a pity party.  I think I just
have to get past what has been and forget it.  Really this person who helped me
seems like a nice person and probably had only good intentions.  She probably
doesn't realize how upset I was either, or that I was even upset at all.  I will
probably be best served by forgetting it.  It also turns out that really I just
have to get past the reviewers and that I don't actually have to get her
approval of any of it; I did need her, especially on my first draft, however.

I am used to the relationship I have with my advisor Dr.\ Helton.  As a grad
student especially, my end goal was to have him approve of what I wrote, and I
simply put in any changes he suggested.  On the other hand, he was very
respectful of me and treated me as being smart; he also asked my opinion on
things, and it became more collaborative.  This experience was not
collaborative or as positive as I am used to; I will keep this in mind in the
future.  On that note, I also don't remember ever having a disagrement with Dr.\
Helton that went this way; any confusion was always cleared up somehow.
Finally, it also seemed that she was a little too busy to really dig in to what
I had done; this gives me a new respect for the time that Dr.\ Helton must have
put in as he went through my work.

Ultimately, in the coming months I likely need her for at least one more
project.  I also should not be irritating any of my colleagues.

Finally, I think in general I have been having a rough time at work from a
self-esteem standpoint.  Although I have the utmost confidence in my ability to
succeed, I mostly have the utmost pessimism about my ability to make a good
impression on others.  I feel I have a lot to prove, yet I feel pessimistic in
having the opportunity to prove what it is I need to prove.  Searching for
employment was a humbling experience.  I felt that I was so smart and capable,
yet I failed to impress those I interviewed with, and ultimately I only received
one job offer.  Even the job offer I received came with a temporary set back as
I was placed in the bottom half of those hired.  Finally, it is humbling to have
gone to a lot of talks already by people who have done tours and are now
(at least on the surface) confident "experts" in what they have done.

This also makes me want to be more careful about where I do the rest of my
internships.  I am growing more suspicious that my office actually isn't that
great.  I might have to learn a lot of life lessons in this office.

UPDATE: I read a bunch of Dilbert comics while I was depressed about all of
this.  A few of the comics suddenly made a lot more sense:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One featured a meeting where Dilbert asked a guy if he thought it would
be a good idea to move some buttons to the top of the screen.  The guy said he
could do it.  Then Dilbert said, "I didn't ask you to do it, I asked if you
thought it would be a good idea."  The guy repeated that he could do it.  After
a few panels of this argument, Dilbert left.  The remaining person asked when
the buttons would be moved.  "As soon as it's my idea."

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Misc. and Not Important}

At work I am learning the text editor Vim.
When one googles best text editor---especially in the context of
programming---one sees there are really two contenders: emacs and vim.  Both of
these have big learning curves.  I figure if I am going to be doing a lot of
computer programming as my profession, I would do well to invest time learning
one of these editors because they supposedly increase ones productivity.

The first few weeks of work I was using emacs.  It was adequate as far as I had
used it.  The key feature of emacs is its incredible extensiblity.  One could
practically use emacs as ones operating system it can do so many things.  All of
use enterring employees started learning emacs together.

Then a week and a half ago, one of my colleagues mentioned that she doesn't use
emacs, she uses Kate.  I thought (1) it was surprising to me that someone at
work didn't use vim or emacs and (2) maybe Kate was a good option.  There were
things about emacs which bugged me, so I jumped over.  Kate had a lot of
similarity to Kile, which is the LaTeX editor I have been using over the past
couple of years.  After a day or two of using it, however, I was not at all
satisfied; yes, it offered a lot of the nice things that Kile offered.  However,
I wasn't interested in merely using the easiest to use text editor; I wanted the
productivity gains offered by a hardcore text editor.

I decided to start using Vim.  There are pluses to emacs over Vim, but I think
for now I am going to focus on Vim.  Here are reasons I am preferring Vim over
emacs at the moment: (1) emacs has crazy key combinations; it kind of hurts my
hands to do them; Vim, on the other hand, is the opposite extreme; the shortcut
layout does the best it can do to keep your fingers in the middle of the
keyboard; (2) for some reason, in the week or so that I have been on Vim, I have
had an easier time figuring out tweaks to increase my productivity; I am well on
my way to having a well customized Vim experience for maximum productivity; and
(3) I think I am more committed to learning every trick which Vim has to offer
because it has a higher learning curve.

At any rate, I think it is a good idea to learn at least one of Vim or emacs,
and to learn well.  It really makes the most sense for me to pick one and put
all my time into learning that one, so for me, I will learn Vim.

\subsection*{July 13, 2013}

I am calmed down from my work frustrations yesterday.  It has (to my benefit)
made me less anxious to work on my computer programming skills at home.

Anna has been sick the past two days.  We haven't gone out today.  Allison is
getting very stir crazy.  I don't have any better ideas, especially since money
is tight.  We discussed the budget some more; our conclusion was that it would
be nice to pay a little bit extra every month on our student loans.

\subsubsection*{Misc. and Not Important}

I stayed up (longer than I should have) learning more about Vim and researching
which is better, Vim or Emacs.  I liked the idea that one can have actual
terminal windows open inside of Emacs; further, some had disparaging things to
say about Vims modal editing; it is more intuitive to be able to just type, and
every other edittor allows one to just type; some threw out that human interface
interaction studies show that Vim's modes are a bad idea; one of my big concerns
with Emacs as well was that the shortcuts are not ergonomically pleasant, but
since Emacs is so customizable, one can certainly change this.  Even still, I
feel like Vim is going to be the way to go for me.  The one letter commands are
much more pleasant for me; further, I am really "getting" the modal nature of
VIm; I feel like in my time with Vim I have picked up more "go-to" commands than
I did with Emacs, and further, I don't need to press Ctrl to use them; I can't
open a terminal inside of Vim, but I can just open another terminal window and
Alt-` between them.

\subsection*{July 14, 2013}

Anna was just as sick as ever, if not more so, today.  She also awoke several
times last night.  Allison is so wonderful to me, and she woke up to tend to
Anna every time.  I stayed home from church and watched Anna while Allison went
to church and did nursery, with the assistance of some sisters who volunteered
to be in there with her.  She said that nursery went well.

It was difficult to get Anna to eat or drink much of anything today.

In the afternoon, we took her temperature and it was 102.9\textdegree.  We
decided to take her into the Instacare.  The doctor there said that she had ear
infections in both ears.  We were prescribed antibiotics.

Luckily, Anna has mostly been taking her medicine very well.  We have been
squirting it into her mouth, and she has been accepting it.  In the past, she
has resisted medicine with all of her efforts, and we have been forced to shove
it down her throat (literally).  Tonight we had a slight hiccup and she didn't
want to take one of her rounds of medicine.  I hope that she gets back to her
good medicine taking habits throughout the next week.

For me, the summary of this weekend is that we stayed home.  I didn't get out at
all.  I was bored.

\subsection*{July 15, 2013}

At work today, I got in early (at 6:30 AM) and the computers weren't fully
working.  They didn't get fixed until after lunch.  It was a slow day.

Anna is slowly getting better from her sickness.  I told Allison that I always
say ice cream is the best medicine.  Allison was feeling a little sick as well,
and so we agreed that I would get some ice cream from the grocery store.  I did
and she started to feel better.

\subsection*{July 16, 2013}
Work was adequate.  I went to a math seminar in the afternoon.  Usually I don't
like going to math talks, and I don't, but I think it is important for me to
start going to them regularly if for nothing else to put myself out there.

Anna has been getting better.  We went to a checkup this afternoon.  Really we
could have cancelled it because clearly she is getting better.  We had a lot of
success with convincing her to calm down for her medicine.  I am glad she is
getting better.  Allison, on the other hand, seems to be not feeling well.
Hopefully she can get better with some extra rest.

\subsubsection*{Unimportant}

I have been learning text editors.  To recap, it is clear from searching the
Internet that the two most popular choices by far for best text editor are Emacs
and Vim.  There are other editors (like Kile) which people use, including people
at work, but I am committed to going through the pain of learning whatever it
takes to do my job to the best of my ability.  (Besides, I can use work time to
learn them, and as a fresh ``intern'' I feel no qualms with doing so.)
At work I have been both Emacs and VIm actually.  By logic, I think that it
would be best to just focus on one of these editors, put in a lot of hours using
them, and by so doing, increase my long-run productivity.  Naturally, however, I
am starting to gravitate towards Vim.  For one, the way Vim works makes sense to
me.  I can see how people would be offput by Vim, but I am starting to really
get it.  As I integrate more and more of the powerful little shortcuts into my
workflow, it becomes harder and harder to give those up and use another editor.
Further, I am figuring out how to customize Vim.  This has potential to make me
even more productive.  I will still use both for the present time and see which
one I end up gravitating towards.  This could also get complicated if I were to
go to an office where they use Windows (yuck!).

\subsection*{July 18, 2013}

I got off work early for our office picnic.  It was fine.  We left early because
it was nap time.

Allison was sick still, so I took Anna out to give Allison peace and quiet to
take a nap.  Anna and I had a spare key made, toodled at Target, and ate at
Chick-Fil-A.  When Anna was done, I asked if she was all done.  She said
``slide?''---they have a play place---and I said OK.  She got super excited
about it and we went to the play place for a couple minutes.  I brought Allison
home some soup.

\subsection*{July 19, 2013}

I got into work at 5:45 in the morning. I wanted to get home early because
Allison has not been feeling well and I wanted to give her some relief from her
responsibilities.  She is actually feeling a little better today.  She had a
good night sleep.

Despite my original intentions, I ended up actually staying for {\it more} than
8 hours of work.  I had a somewhat easier time finding things to do with my time
at work.

Overall, I am working hard on my computer skills.  I have gotten {\it pretty}
good at Perl and am starting to get better at Vim.  Vim has a big learning curve
it seems to me because being good at it is so much about muscle memory and
practice.

\subsection*{July 20, 2013}

Today we decided to stay in so that Allison could continue to get better.

Keith came this afternoon.  He will be staying with us for a couple
months. We expect that it will be fine, and we are hoping to benefit
from him having access to the commisary for cheaper food and him
paying a little bit in rent to us.  We all went out to Outback
Steakhouse because he had a gift card he needed to use.

\subsection*{July 21, 2013}

Church was good today.  It was nice to have Allison with me in nursery.  Our
nursery time went well.  The children in there are funny.

Our $2^{\rm nd}$ floor toilet clogged, so we called in a plumber to fix it.
With his tool he fixed it easily, but we were out \$85 dollars all the same.
Keeping our budget is tricky; we have set ourselves up with thin margins for
error.

I am wondering about my current weekday schedule.  Lately I have been going in
to work between 5:45 and 6:45.  I like this for a few reasons: (1) I like being
alone in my cubicle at the beginning of the day to work on whatever I want; (2)
I always enjoy good traffic both when I get into work and when I leave work; (3)
Getting in early is the only way to get good parking; (4) I like getting home in
the early afternoon as opposed to the late afternoon.  The thing I have been
struggling with is fitting in everything I want to do.  I would like to go
jogging in the morning and study my scriptures.  I have mostly been getting my
scripture study done at some time during my day, but I haven't jogged for a
while.  Further, it has been a struggle for me to stop working after my
eight-hour day.  I have a desire to get better at computer programming; I felt
inadequate as I interviewed at offices as they all asked what my computer
programming background was, and I could only respond that it was pretty weak.  I
feel a compulsion to do whatever I can to practice computer skills with every
free moment I get.  On the other hand, Allison really wants me to ``be home''
when I am home.  She becomes frustrated when I take time out to work on my
laptop on figuring out computer stuff.

I need to find balance.

\subsection*{July 22, 2013}

\subsubsection*{Morning thoughts}

I need to have more faith in my ability to do my work in 8 hours.  My underlying
loyalty should be to Allison and Anna.  I think I am not seeing what is most
important for me in my life.  I googled last night the topic, ``what time should
I wake up''.  The top result was an article about what time CEOs wake up and
talked about their busy schedule.  On the other hand, there was a link from
Mormon.org about halfway down the page which was about spending family time
instead of ``me'' time.  The latter link was more important I think.  At any
rate, not only is it more valuable for me to spend family time, I need to be
content with the work I can accomplish in my 8 hour day.

\subsubsection*{Summary of the Day}

I went into work at 6 AM.  I had a day where I had to focus on ``small stuff''
instead of my most important projects.  I still have some outstanding ``small''
items which I need to ask for help on; I am a little embarrassed seeing that I
have let this slide for so long.  I fear that I will get negative feedback for
letting something just slide like I have.

In the afternoon I had a tour interview in an office with a long waitlist.  I
wasn't blown away by it.  I still don't know what to do for my next tour.

Anna had a hard time getting to sleep tonight.

\subsection*{July 23, 2013}

I got into work a little after 6 this morning.  No one came into my cubicle for
about three hours.

I have settled into a routine at work where I just work hard alone.  It may not
be a good thing for me to do this because I ought to make connections with
people.  I got to a tough point in a project I have been working on; after work,
I realized that I ought to ask my tour mentor about it instead of toughing
through it for a while.

At the end of my work day I went to a talk on something I will learn more about
in a few months, but which as of now I am mostly clueless about.  It bored me.

I came home tired once again.

\subsection*{July 24, 2013}

I would categorize today as a rough day at work.

First, I decided to sleep in until after 6:30 (I have been waking before 6 every
day).  I at least felt rested all day, so it was a good decision.  I had to stay
at work until 5 PM, but it was fine.  It turned out that I was not close to
being the last one in my bay---I don't like being the last one because I have to
do stuff.

Yesterday I made a work mistake.  I emailed about a week ago to ask to meet with
the program heads to talk about how my tour is going.  I got a reply back from
one of them saying that after the seminar would be good.  I waited a few minutes
after the seminar, and everyone cleared out.  I was unsure if anyone even
remembered that I was coming to meet them.  Instead of looking for people, which
is what I should have done, I just left to go home.  I then sent an email this
morning asking for a time not after one of the seminars.  I got no reply back.
I am thinking I made a very bad impression.

Then today I went to a seminar about how to ``get ahead'' at my work.  The truth
of the matter is that one must excel at networking (among other things).  It
made me feel like I will never get ahead at work.  I have 100\% confidence in my
ability to do work and 0\% confidence in my ability to network.  Further, as I
mentioned, I already made a bad impression with my supervisor.  Things are not
looking up.

I actually made progress on my ``big project''.  I asked my tour mentor about an
issue I had run into yesterday, and I came to a relatively easy resolution to
the problem.  Further, I noticed a glitch in the existing code; I was working
off of an old script, and it actually appears that this glitch silently was
present in the old code.  I was lucky to notice it and be able to fix it.  It
made me excited to do better than the existing code.  On the flip side, it made
me sad for myself because it was the kind of thing that usually no one else will
notice and/or appreciate.  So my code is basically ``done''; there is one
``small'' change I would like to make, but other than that I am done with my
rough draft.

It makes me uneasy however.  I have no idea how I am doing.  I feel like that I
am doing well because of how hard I work and how I seem to be ``far along'' in
my knowledge of Perl.  Further, I have done a lot to clear out some of the
backlogs of work that our team has.  However, I don't think I am doing ``well.''
I have a feeling
that I am making a bad impression on my coworkers because I basically have no
social skills.  I spend a lot of time in my own corner working alone on things.
I must come off like a total grump.  My coworkers will often stop and have
conversations, whereas I am engrossed in my work.  There is a guy who is one
level above our office whose office is housed in our office; he will often walk
by to different offices and---from my perspective, at least---chat with people;
I mostly figured out he was higher up because of the respect and attention other
people in my office give him.  There is a definite disconnect between how I
interact with people---I mostly don't interact with people, and when I do, I
don't very well---and how others interact with people.  I am a total introvert.
If I could, I would have a job where I could just do work and not have to talk
to anyone.

My stomach was in knots when I left work today.  In my weakness, I wondered if
this is the job for me.  I have previously had the mindset that I am just going
to stay in this job until I retire.  My feelings have given me pause.  Maybe I
was not meant to do this job.  In that case, what should I try to take from my
time here?  Computer programming is a big thing to take, no question.  I am
going to have to proceed with faith.

\subsubsection*{Unimportant: Editors}

Of the editors, I think I am sticking with Vim.  Mostly, I feel better about
it.  Tangibly, Vim feels more comfortable for my fingers.  Vim's modes make it
so I can often use single fingers to do commands.  That's better than an
``easy'' editor.  That's much better than Emacs, which is very heavy on multiple
key combinations, especially with the left pinky, and often with a key far from
the ctrl key.  I have also discovered Gvim, which makes it so I can use Vim with
the mouse.  I was introduced to these editors with the idea that being good at
the keyboard is better than using a mouse; I somewhat disagree because I think
that there are tasks I can use the mouse very efficiently to do.  The Gvim
program allows me to use a mouse, which is a wonderful thing.

\subsection*{July 25, 2013}

\subsubsection*{Morning thoughts} I went to bed at about 9:45, so my body woke
me up at about 4:45.  In days past I would have gone into work early, but today
I will not.  We are planning on Allison taking me to work.  Further, I think I
am done with coming in super early.

I have given more thought to switching jobs this morning.  The thought leaves me
feeling OK.  I don't feel bad about it.  Logically, I ought to stay here for a
couple years.  Everybody is looking for ``experience'', so I need to gain as
much experience as possible.  Once I get that experience I have no idea what I
will be doing for a career, but I especially know I need computer experience.
Honestly, it makes me feel like I should spend the next two years
here, culminating with a 10-week tour of La Jolla.  We would be done with our
lease by then and free to move to whatever part of the country we wish.

I have gained a lot of respect for what the organization does, but I don't know
if I am a good fit for this organization.

I am psychologically crumbling right now.  I am not handling the (imagined?)
pressures of the job.  The biggest thing that I have been beating myself up over
is the social aspect.  I tell myself that anything which involves me talking to
people in order to get is something I am not going to be able to get.  When I
see people give talks, I tell myself that I could not give such a talk because I
don't possess that certain ``it''.

For the longest time I haven't really known how I actually compare to others.
Instead of finding out, I just assume that I am not doing well compared to
others.  In this particular job, it has driven me to work really hard.  Even in
tasks that require little to no intelligence, I try to do everything better,
faster, and harder than everyone else.  It's also very unhealthy because no
matter how well I do, I still ultimately think that I am not going to get ahead.

I also fear that my tour mentor won't recognize or realize the hard work I am
putting in.  I have begun to fear a bad review of my performance is coming.

I feel miserable working under my self-made psychological conditions.  There is
a lot of fear.

\subsubsection*{Rest of the Day}

I had a much better attitude during the rest of the day.  I worked harder to
talk to my coworkers.  I was able to talk to an intern in our office who is in
another development program (she only has a bachelor's).  She relayed to me that
she also is experiencing many of the same difficulties as I am.  I also started
to have more positive self talk.  If I can do as well at the ``work'' part as I
believe I can, then I should be OK here.

\subsection*{July 26, 2013}

I had a decent day of work.  I am more or less at a completion point
of my rough draft of my big project.  I also felt I made some
breakthroughs on understanding everything else that goes on in the
office.  I am hopeful that I can use this momentum to ``catch up''
on things and really get things down.  I also had a few minutes to
start another smaller project on my to do list.  Today I read an
email regarding the evaluations that are going on (which I am exempt
from by not having been here for a while).  It makes a difference
when people can finish projects at a much faster pace than usual.  I
am really hoping to start knocking out some projects so that I can
reach that level.

I was invited to a ``happy hour'' with work people.  It ended up
being a get together between us interns who always hang out and one
other person who works there.  They all drank, but I had a cup of
water and a burger.  I was glad to go because I need to build
relationships with people.

\subsection*{July 27, 2013}

Last Sunday, Allison and I were given the topic of personal
revelation and inspiration as our subjects.  I was a bit surprised
because I feel like I always talk on that subject.  So I started
preparing my talk by pulling out an old talk on the same subject
along with some notes with a lot of material on this
very subject.  All I had to do was feel inspired about how I had to
rearrange everything and I would be done with my talk.  Of course, I
received no such inspiration.  As I read through all the material I
had, I just didn't feel like I should use any of it, so I had
nothing.  To make matters worse, in the days that followed, I felt a
big writers block as far as what to put in this talk.  I know that
the when we give talks, so without the spirit guiding me, I had
nothing to put in my talk.

In one of my singles wards, I was in a Sunday School class where the
teacher told the class that in his class no one was allowed to share
mission stories.  In his view, you should have spiritual experiences
beyond the two years you served your mission.  This attitude was
something I had never come across, and as a result I became a lot
more reticent to share my mission experiences with other people.  It
was no longer ``cool'' to do so.  This attitude continued with me
until this week.

Today my spritual experience was that I felt reprimanded for feeling
this way about my mission.  My mission was a blessing from the Lord.
I should do a better job of cherishing that blessing.  Further, I am
entirely too nonchalant about my spiritual experiences.  They are
blessings which I should feel good about.

\subsection*{July 28, 2013}

I gave a talk in church today.  It was short, which ended up being
fine because the last speaker, a soon-to-be missionary, ended up
going over actually.  I spoke of my accident and my mission, which
I usually avoid talking about, but I felt that I ought to do so.  I
think it was adequate.

We went on a drive over to the Washington, D.C., temple.  They have
a nice visitors center which was redone within the last year.  We
had a nice time.

Allison was irritated today by our situation with Keith.  I guess we
haven't been very clear about our food situation because he has been
eating our food.  He ate some leftovers which Allison was saving for
my lunch---I will now be having ham and cheese sandwiches for lunch
tomorrow.  We decided that she would mention how we would like Keith
to pay some money towards our food seeing that we can't really
afford to give him free food, and seeing that he most certainly has
more money to spare then we do.

\subsection*{July 29, 2013}

I passed on my rough draft of my big project to my tour mentor.  Of
course I started to think that it was in a lot worse shape then I
thought.

I then knocked out another script today.  I figured out a lot of
things related to the proprietary software packages which I didn't
previously know.  (Incdidentally, the girl who was working on this
with me told me to do things in the last script which imply to me
that perhaps she too doesn't know all the things I figured out.)

On the negative side, there are still a lot of fundamental things
on my plate which I am very lost on.  I am going to have to ask a
lot of (stupid) questions at work tomorrow to try to catch up a
little bit.  (My time management has been to work in a very lopsided
manner---I have really done well at a few things, and have
completely left the rest of my tasks undone.)

I also put in a little bit of time to start reading {\it
Intermediate Perl}.  I have been giving thought to my work and to
the question of how can I do better; one thing that is a clear
stumbling block is how long it has taken me to write some of my Perl
scripts.  Therefore I have asked, ``What makes a great programmer?''
I googled the question, and read some perspectives.  Among other
things, I saw a parallel between knowing a programming language and
knowing a spoken language.  I recalled my mission and how
missionaries reach a plateau with their language.  Once basic
fluency is gained, it is easy to relax and stop improving.  I had to
put in extra effort to keep studying Portuguese on my mission, and
by so doing I was able to still get better at Portuguese.  I
therefore am motivated to keep putting in the effort to refine my
Perl; I can become a better programmer by learning how to write
things succintly using intermediate and advanced tricks.

We went to the pool tonight.  Allison stayed out of the water while
Anna and I were in the pool playing.  After swimming, we played on
the adjacent playground.  It was a lot of fun.

\subsection*{July 30, 2013}

I fell asleep on the couch last night.  I woke at around 3:30 and
couldn't get back to sleep.  I eventually just went into work---I
got to my desk at 5:55.  I decided to work a 9 1/2 hour day.  My day
was moderately successful.  I feel more and more as if I am figuring
things out.  I had some programming challenges today which I was
able to solve quickly; I feel as if I am becoming good at debugging.

My mom and Paul came into town.  It was good to have them here.
They will be staying with us for a week.  We went to Mission BBQ for
dinner, per my request.

\section{}

\subsection*{August 1, 2013}

Today I worked only a half day.  Likely this pay period is the first
pay period where I will be cashing in any credit hours.

\subsection*{August 2, 2013}

Today I worked for 6 hours.  I have mostly finished my big project
for the tour and I have also basically finished another project.  As
such, I don't have a big project to pour my time into.  Next week
might be tricky for me to find meaningful work.

On Wednesday, I went to interview with the head of the development
program.  It was said that I shouldn't just be a code monkey in my
internship.  In the moment, it didn't really ring true to me that my
internship was like that.  Upon further reflection, I am seeing that
my internship is mostly me being a code monkey.  For one, I read the
weekly notes of the other interns.  They seem to be doing a lot of
stuff beyond computer programming.  My impression of what they are
doing is looking at problems and using their analytic skills to
solve them; their tours have been much closer to being a
mathematician than mine has.

On the flip side, I still mostly feel good about my internship.  I
went into the internship with a lot less programming experience than
the other interns; at this point, I am sure I know a lot more Perl
than the other interns do.  Next, I believe that the work I have
done so far has been ``useful''.  It is work that needs to get done
by someone, so might as well be me.  Some of this work is taking
tasks and automating them with scripting.  I am not going to do
things the slow way, so it is somewhat automatic that I will work on
automating things.  And even if it doesn't work out for me, at least
my internship will be, after taking out class and vacation, about 4
1/2 months.

I am starting to feel sick from too much eating out.

\subsection*{August 3, 2013}

We had a low key day with family.

I am going to have to do better with making time for my family.  I
have been obsessed with practicing my computer skills.  For example,
I have been doing problems on the Project Euler website, which are
essentially computer math problems.  In and of themselves, they are
good practice.  However, is there value in doing them at home when I
could (should) be spending time with my family?

\subsection*{August 4, 2013}

Church went well today.  We had 11 kids in our nursery class but it
seemed to go well.

We had ribs for dinner, made with Phil's BBQ sauce.  Yum!

We have been havng Anna sit on her potty before her baths.  Today
before her bath I put her on the potty, and she went pee pee in the
potty for the very first time.  Unfortunately I was the only one to
witness it, but it was very exciting.

\subsection*{August 5, 2013}

My tour mentor sent me an email last Friday with a list of
things to do next week.  One of the things was a project which---I
didn't tell her this beforehand, which is my fault---I basically had
finished.  There was one thing which I think I will be able to knock
out within a couple hours tomorrow.  The last thing is something
which (a) is dependent on waiting for someone else to pass me back
something and (b) is not very much work on my part.  So what I am
saying is that I am almost out of things to do at work this week and
it is only Monday.  I have a few things to turn to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\label{it:1_0805} Figure out how to ask for more work.

	\item\label{it:2_0805} Figure out some of the little nagging
	issues I am still not understanding but was going to ask for more
	help on.

	\item\label{it:3_0805} Take time out to finally learn C.
\end{enumerate}
Item (\ref{it:1_0805}) is probably going to have to happen at some
point.  Item (\ref{it:2_0805}) is not preferrable, but maybe it is
for the best.  I have been thinking about doing (\ref{it:3_0805})
for a while, but haven't felt good about starting it; perhaps this
week is my week.

One thing I told the development program head is that I have been
building a list of projects to start when I am done with my other
projects.  I am seeing that my list is not so valid because I don't
know what projects are actually important to do; I should just ask
someone what are good projects.

We went out to eat in honor of my birthday next week.  I decided to
go to Mission BBQ again.  I think that some people in the family
were underwhelmed by the choice, but it was for my birthday, so we
went there anyway.

We played a lot of Great Dalmuti tonight.  We unfortunately also had
{\it The Bachelorette} on in the background.

\subsection*{August 6, 2013}

When I got to work and started at it, I realized that I actually had
quite a bit to do.  One task which I thought would be easy actually
was hard to decipher: it involved Python, not Perl, and I didn't
really know what was going on; I will be able to talk to someone
about it tomorrow.  Another task is one I have been in one way or
another working on since I started in my office; I haven't really
grasped the breadth of this task yet, but I am starting to figure it
out; it is probably a little embarassing that it has taken so long
to figure out as much as I have, actually.  So this week I will
actually have my hands full (1) tackling this indecipherable task
and (2) learning more about things I should know by now.

We went out to eat for the last time; my mom and Paul are going home
tomorrow.  I have been lucky enough to get off work early the past
few days.

\subsection*{August 7, 2013}

My mom and Paul went home today.  I was able to take off from work
early today to see them off.  I was glad that they could come and
spend time with us.  It was truly a blessing.  Further, Anna had a
really good time with my mom and really loved having her here.  They
left while Anna was napping to avoid a tearful goodbye.

Due to eating out so much over the past few days, physically I feel
horrible.

I worked for four solid hours today.  I took one bathroom break,
solved the daily puzzle in a couple minutes, but beyond that I was
purely working.  I had a frustrating day; I am wasting a lot of time
on things that really I should get people to explain to me; however,
people are busy; further, I hate asking for help, and usually I try
to figure things out for myself.  I also am disliking being an
``intern''.  I feel like I get looked down upon by some people.  I
am also frustrated, as I have been this week, with a lack of big
intern projects.  I feel an urgency to accomplish great things to
get a promotion to earn more money for the family.  On the other
hand, (1) I don't need to move up in anything as long as I am taking
care of my family, and (2) I don't necessarily need to worry about
getting ahead where I am if down the line I can switch to a
different job somewhere else.

\subsection*{August 8, 2013}

I woke up around 4 AM with an upset stomach.  It is going to take me
a few days to get over the past week of eating out.  I need to learn
my lesson once and for all about eating right.

I went to buy some Peptol Bismol at around 5 AM.  I took some and
felt some stomach relief, so I decided to go back to bed.
Unfortunately, my stomach relief didn't last, and I didn't get back
to sleep.  I went to work at around 5:45.  I planned to work about 8
1/2 hours and then go to my dental appointment at 3:45.  As the
morning wore on, I started to feel worse and worse.  I eventually
gave in and left work at around 1 PM.  I then came home and took a
nap.  I had to suck it up and (probably) take some leave time this
pay period.

On the plus side, I think it would have been a great day at work if
not for feeling completely physically drained.

\subsection*{August 9, 2013}

I was able to get a lot of sleep last night and have enough energy
for a day of work.  To make up for the week I had, I worked 10 hours
and 15 minutes.  That means I don't have to use any leave time this
pay period.  This is a great blessing.

I am really down about my current work situation.  At the class
lunch today, the development program head mentioned to everyone how
in tours like mine I shouldn't be stuck doing just a bunch of
coding.  As I have examined what I am doing at work, I see a real
disconnect between what I am doing and what I ideally should be
doing.  For example, I have started observing my fellow interns more
and have seen that they are doing things which involve much more
than just being a codemonkey.

I know that I hate asking questions and, in fact, I like to ask as
little questions as possible.  On the other hand, I am also upset
that my tour mentor has let me spend all my time on low level tasks.

I am going to have to talk to my tour mentor next week about this
issue.  I am uncomfortable doing this, but my tour is turning out
poorly because of this.  If my tour ends up being a lot of coding, I
will have very little to show of myself from it.  A part of me is
wishing that I can just get out of this office now; if I had the
chance to do so, I would probably take it (even though such a thing
is probably discouraged).

I want to do well at my job.  I still carry with me (1) that I
didn't get any other job offers and (2) that I was on the bottom
half of people hired for this job.  I have done my best, I think, to
do my job as I understood it.  I thought that I could just do what I
was told to the best of my abilities and that would be great.

\subsection*{August 10, 2013}

I have been doing more thinking about my situation at work.  Maybe I
have been giving my tour mentor the benefit of the doubt.  As I have
thought about things, however, I realize that she hasn't been
checking in on me.  Further, to set me up for a whole week of her
going on vacation, she sent me one email with tasks; those tasks
were computer programming related, and I finished them easily.

Of course, I am anxious about the whole situation.  I don't do well
with things hanging over my head.

\subsection*{August 11, 2013}

Church was good today.  Our nursery kids were fairly well-behaved.

I have been trying to get over being so stressed out about work.  I
recognize that for the past few months I have been constantly
stressed out.  I haven't had very much fun at all over the past
while.

\subsection*{August 12, 2013}

I was overreacting to my work plight.  That being said, it was a
slow day of work.

We went to Target and Old Navy.  I stocked up on cheap flip flops.
My previous sandals broke a couple days ago, so I was glad to get
them replaced.  I paid \$2 a piece for them, and there was no tax on
them because Maryland is having a week of no sales tax on certain
items for back to school.  We also had a lot of fun as a family.
Anna is learning the concept of stop and go; we played stop and go
with the shopping cart and she was calling out stop and go.  She was
even making the hand motion for stop.

We have also had fun singing the Bubble Guppies theme with her.
Last night we sang it a bunch of times while she was taking a bath,
and she was thrashing around and splashing like crazy.  It was a lot
of fun.

\subsection*{August 14, 2013}

I have been having a lot to do at work.  After I asked for new
projects, they were given to me, so now I have tons of projects.
Right now I am in the phase where I am anew struggling to understand
how to do things.  I am hopeful that I will be able to tackle all my
new projects and successfully complete them.

Tonight we went to Dunkin Donuts and had a donut each.  I made the
mistake of asking Anna if she wanted to go out, and so she was
determined to make it happen until we finally took a drive with her.
She is a good daughter!

\subsection*{August 15, 2013}

I was wrong this weekend about my internship.  It appears that by
asking for more to do at work I was given more to do then I have had
time to get to.  My projects pile is overflowing.  I have been truly
blessed.  I have all these projects now even though we are getting
another intern this week to join my same team to work under one of
the team members.  Last week I would have been very concerned about
this because it felt like there wasn't enough for me to do, much
less for two interns to do; this week, I realize that there is
actually a lot to do and that I will be fine as long as I
communicate.

Ironically, I have also had opportunity this week to hear about my
fellow interns' internships and how they have not had a lot to do.
Once again, I felt blessed this week to have a lot to do now, and I
feel grateful I talked to my tour mentor about it.

I went home early to watch Anna while Allison went to the dentist to
see about her jaw.  Her jaw is not opening up all the way.  The
dentist could do nothing for her.  If she could take ibuprofin she
would be better probably, but she can't of course because she is
pregnant.

\subsection*{August 16, 2013}

It was my birthday today.  Per my wishes, we didn't spend any money.
Allison made her enchiladas with pork in them, which I enjoyed.  So
we actually did spend money when we went to Rita's for desert; we
got a Starburst strawberry Italian ice.  We also had another desert
because Allison made oreo cookies---cookies made out of other
cookies.  At night we were able to play a spades game to completion.
Also, Allison gave me more coupons---I loved her Book 'o Coupons
that she gave me last year.

Work was worky.  I had a list of things piling up prior to today,
and I was able to knock out a couple of them today and get to a
couple more.  I have now at least looked at everything on my list of
things to do.  There is just a bit of ``pain'' involved in tackling
a new project, and a lot of my day was tackling new, small projects.

\subsection*{August 17, 2013}

We had a low key Saturday.  Allison tried to print some pictures for
my birthday but they came back fuzzy.  It turned out that she
emailed them from her phone to herself which decreased the picture
quality to an unacceptable level.  We were able to locate the
full-resolution pictures on her laptop and then print out some full
quality pictures at Walgreens.  This afternoon we also went to
Target and Allison found some great deals on maternity clothes she
had been needing.  We then topped it off with a trip to Chick-Fil-A.
We let Anna go in the play place; it was touch and go for a while
because she unexpectedly climbed up to the top level where you can't
see anything and she stayed up there for a couple minutes; luckily,
some of the older girls in there were kind enough to take her down
the slide with them.

\subsection*{August 18, 2013}

We had a good day of church.  Our nursery class went well.  We did
have one weird occurance: when all of the parents left, we noticed
that there was a baby, approximately 18 months old, in our class.
We had no idea whose baby he was or what his name was.  We had him
taken to the younger class.  About an hour later his mom popped into
the room asking where he was.  She said his cousin was in the class,
so she thought it would be a good idea to drop him off there.  It
was amazing how different a year or so in age makes in the ability
of the kids; there was no way we could have just kept him in the
older class.

I am grateful for my circumstances at this point in my life.  I was
in a bad spot from January through March.  I am grateful to not have
to teach for a living.  I am also grateful to make enough money to
meet our needs.

\subsection*{August 19, 2013}

We had our hospital tour tonight.  It was a challenge to keep Anna
occupied for an hour; we basically used the iPhones to entertain
her.  It seems like a nice hosptial.  It was also comforting to know
that we have prior experience to fall back on for this baby.

I had an OK day of work; I spent a lot of time on things I felt like
doing but which did not yield instantaneous tangible results.

\subsection*{August 20, 2013}

I had a worky day of work.

I was able to go to church basketball tonight.  I had a good time
and got in some good exercise.

\subsection*{August 21, 2013}

I took Allison and Anna to the airport this morning.  Allison had a
long flight to St.\ George with Anna.  Anna was full of energy the
whole flight.  When they finally got on the shuttle to go to St.\
George from Las Vegas, Anna babbled for literally the whole two hour
trip.  Then, when they got a ride home to the Sullivan home, Anna
finally fell asleep, which of course meant that she had a very short
nap.  She was full of energy when she got home and saw all of the
things with which she could play.

I actually woke up today around 3:30 AM.  When I got home from the
airport I actually didn't fall asleep.  I have been working really
hard at getting in some practice with computer programming and with
Vim.  I programmed on Vim until around 8 AM, at which time I went to
work.  I stayed at work until 5:30.  Work was adequate.  I am a
little bit overwhelmed with some of the projects I have now been
given.  I am still at the beginner phase with most of my projects.
I am going to have to work hard, but be patient, with some of my
projects, and hopefully I will have success.  I wonder if there is a
better way to do things than the way I have been working at work.  I
feel like I am doing OK at focusing in on things, specifically
computer programming, but I am still having a really hard time
getting into my new projects, which are not just simple computer
programming tasks.  Further, I found an extra computer programming
task to do, so I have been working on that as well.  Further, I
spent a good chunk of time coding up a solver for this week's daily
puzz.

Allison said that there is a serious buyer interested in the Green
Machine.  Since the car has not sold yet, we were thinking that we
would just keep it; however, if we can get near the asking price for
it, I think we would have to take it and pay down our student loans.
To get near \$4000 put towards student loans would be a great
relief---if we are thinking that we are taking approximately 5 years
to pay off the loan, then we would be saving about \$1600 by putting
it all towards student loans.

\subsection*{August 22, 2013}

I had a 20 minute scripture study this morning.  I have been
typically spending much less time on scripture study than that
lately, so it was important to do.  Further, I like the timed
scripture studies where I just focus on learning.  I know that the
gospel is true; I feel the spirit in my life every day.  When I
follow the spirit, good things happen.

Unfortunately, I have lately been wasting a lot of time on text
editors and computer programming.  I have been bringing home Vim,
Perl, and Linux questions from work to look up on Google at home.  I
suppose it's fine to look up a couple things, but I have been going
overboard.  When Allison and Anna left for their vacation, I was
thinking that I could really dig into these topics and make some
work progress.  However, I have felt not to do this.  I have to
trust this instinct and not pour so much time into things that don't
have value.

I worked for 10:15 today.  I found that I got my second wind
somewhere around 5:30, which is much later than I usually would be
working.  I ended up working until around 7:15.  It was fine.

\subsection*{August 23, 2013}

I had a dream that the new baby came.  Among other things, I
realized that we didn't have a name.  The conclusion I came to this
morning is that I will probably just cave to Allison's wishes and
let her give the first name of the baby.  Maybe I can plop on a
middle name that I like which Allison doesn't.

Work was fine.  I decided to only do 8 $\frac{1}{2}$ hours instead
of something more ambitious like 10 hours.  I didn't feel like
working that long on a Friday.

I know that I complained about getting a lot of programming tasks in
my tour, but it turns out that in reality I am mostly interested in
learning about programming, and really, I gravitate towards the
programming tasks.  When faced with the task of diving into a new
project that didn't have much to do with programming, I ended up
finding some unrelated programming projects to work on.  I even
dumped a lot of time into writing some code to solve the daily puzz.
When I wrote up my week, I realized that I didn't really work on any
big projects but did a ton of little things.  Next week I hope to
make some good progress on other new projects which I have yet to
really get started on.

After getting things done, I still spent a lot of time on Vim stuff.
There is a lot to be done to customize Vim.  I had a full page,
front and back, of things to add to my .vimrc just from tonight.

\subsection*{August 24, 2013}

Today is the first day in a long time where Allison and Anna aren't
home and I have nothing to do because it's Saturday.  I went to
Staples and bought some printer ink and printer paper.  I want to be
able to print out some computer stuff I am working on for work, and
it really is too much to just write out. (100 lines already is too
much.)  I only got black ink because it was the cheapest option for
what we need.  I went to Five Guys today, my first time in Maryland.
It was good.  This is probably going to be my only eating out for
the time Allison is gone.

I spent a lot of time working on Vim.  I wrote some scripts in Perl
to align equals signs and make comment boxes, and then I had Vim use
them to do said things with shortcuts.  It was a very obsessive
thing to do.  Then I started reading the book \textit{Vimscript the
Hard Way} with a goal of writing lots of useful functions in the
language of Vim.  I really pounded away at Vim today.  By the
evening time I was tired out from it.  I used the new ink in the
printer, however, to print out what I had done today.  I had six
pages of small-typed code.  This is a sign that I am obsessive.

I am realizing more and more how much Allison does for me.  The main
lesson I am taking from this experience is how much I need to help
out around the house more.  I also need to take care of my body so
that I have energy to do so.

\subsection*{August 25, 2013}

I went to church today alone for the first time in a while.  Allison
was nice enough to ask brothers to sub for her (even though I feel
like I should have done it) and so I had help.  It went very
smoothly.  The sacrament talks were also very good.

Today I took a Sunday nap because I was bored.  It turned out that
while I was napping Allison repeatedly tried to call me.  She sold
our car, the Green Machine, which we had been trying to sell since
May.  We ended up getting \$3400 out of it, which all things
considered, is pretty good.  We may invest in a minivan and have two
cars.  We may use the money to pay down our student loans.  We
probably will have to do the former because when the new baby comes
Allison isn't really going to be able to give me rides to work
anymore as she has, so without a second car she would be stranded
every day.  It is tempting to pay down the loans, however, because
of all the money we would save.

I was mostly bored this afternoon.  I was fortunate to be able to
chat with some family today, but mostly I was left to my own
devices.  Unfortunately, I chose to take a nap this afternoon, so I
am not tired at 11 at night.

\subsubsection*{General thoughts about life}

I was reviewing the beginning of the year of this journal.  I feel a
great peace in my heart that I don't have to go into teaching.  I
feel like I am blessed to have not pursued it because I probably
would have failed at it.  I recalled the horror I felt at having
such scathing reviews by my students the last quarter I taught.

I'm not mad that I didn't get the BYU job or that my academic search
was a bust.  I feel a much greater sense of peace in my current
employment.  I feel that I am on the right track.  I cannot
adequately express why my current job situation is so much better.
Perhaps it boils down to three points I always think of: (1) better
work/life balance (fixed 40 hours a week, no work outside of the
office), (2) better work environment (this is hard to fully
articulate, but for one thing I don't have to teach a lecture full
of college students), and (3) better pay (by far).


\subsection*{August 26, 2013}

I was hungry and tired all day.  To make matters worse, we
discovered that Keith probably, thinking they were up for grabs
leftovers, ate my remaining pre-prepared meals for the week.  I went
to Firehouse Subs instead and spent \$10.  Hard day.

\subsection*{August 27, 2013}

I had more energy today.  I worked 9 hours and 15 minutes today.  I
then went home teaching in the evening which was very good for me.
I then went to Chick-Fil-A for dinner, which was probably a
suboptimal decision, but at least I am fed.

\subsection*{August 28, 2013}

I picked up Allison and Anna from the airport.  It was good to have
them both back.  I am lucky to have them.  We went out to eat
tonight because there was no food at home.  It was a tiring day for
everyone involved.

Work was fine.  I am working on an "open-ended" project which is
probably a little too open ended.  I have a lack of direction in my
work right now; I don't really have anything that I am working
towards; I like having something I am working towards.

\subsection*{August 29, 2013}

We went to cash our check for the sale of the Green Machine as well
as deposit my birthday money and some other cash we had on hand.
Anna is starting to get good at her ABCs and counting.  She is a
funny little girl.  Allison is starting to get really pregnant.  She
tells me that it is starting to get uncomfortable for her.

Work was worky.  I am starting to understand the open ended project
I have been working on.  I feel that it is still a long battle to
being able to fully understand it however.  I worked for 8:45 today.
For the next month I am probably going to push to start working 9
hour days so that I can max out my credit time.

\subsection*{August 30, 2013}

I went to work for only four hours today.  I got two hours of
administrative leave today, so I only lose two hours today.  I left
early because I had a dentist appointment.  I got three fillings.  I
am glad to finally get my teeth fixed.

We went to Coldstone today because my mouth was sore and numb from
my fillings.  We then toodled at Target, and then after dinner we
went to the park.  Anna loves the swing and the slide.  Also, we
learned that apparently she can say bike and knows what bikes are.
It was a pretty good day.

\subsection*{August 31, 2013}

We went to the ward picnic today.  We only stayed to eat because it
was around Anna's nap time.

I am somewhat addicted to computer stuff at the moment.  I have been
very driven to learn computer programming from the moment I started
my internship period in my office.  I have spent a lot of time doing
Project Euler problems---they are mathematical problems to be solved
using computer programming.  In the past couple weeks I have shifted
my focus to mastering Vim.  I put in a lot of time last week into
customizing Vim and learning how to ``program'' it to do what I want
it to do.

I feel like this obsession is destructive.  When I am around my
family, I keep thinking about how I could do more to get ahead.  I
feel that it is time to step back and give it a break.  If I gave
into my natural impulse, I could spend all day every day working on
getting better at Vim.  It is fun to me to learn things like this,
but I ultimately am not getting the big picture of what is really
important in life.  Part of the reason I took this job is because I
wanted to be able to spend adequate time with my family.  What is
the point if I then take my free time and funnel it back into work?

Even from a work point of view I am spending too much time on Vim.
The point of putting in effort to learn a text editor is that it
will make you faster at programming and will pay off in the long
run.  However, if I am spending all this time learning the text
editor, I don't think that I am really getting any time savings.  I
can stand to take a break from learning how to be better at my text
editor and reap the benefit of all that I have learned.

\subsection*{September 1, 2013}

Church was good today.  Our nursery class went well.  It is too bad
that we will be released when Allison gives birth because it feels
like we are doing a good job.

In the afternoon we were able to chat with family and then go on a
family walk.

Anna is really learning a lot of words lately.  Today she said
"frog" when she saw some frogs on her pajamas, which she hadn't said
before (to my knowledge).

\subsection*{September 2, 2013}

For lunch we went to the restaurant Mi Pueblo.  It was delicious as
it was the first time we went.  I got the same thing as last time;
it was a dish including a large portion of pork, a half an avocado,
onions, beans, rice, and tomato.  Yum!

In the afternoon we spent time at the mall.  It was really busy
because of the holiday, so we cut our time short in the mall area.
We then got some Ritas Italian Ice as a treat.

Anna's funniest funny was that she picked up her toy phone in the
car and said "allo?" to it.

\subsection*{September 3, 2013}

Work was worky.  I feel as if I have enough projects on my plate to
last me until the end of my internship, and maybe will last me more
than the six months I was originally planning.  It is humbling and
frustrating to be mired in such projects.  I feel like I don't make
much progress from day to day.  I am always trying to listen to the
spirit on these projects to figure out the best use of my time.  It
has been a struggle because I have been inspired to take actions
which are contrary to what I want or to what I logically think I
ought to do.

I had a nice time after work.  It was a normal night hanging out at
home.

\subsection*{September 4, 2013}

I was supposed to go help give a blessing at 7 PM.  I showed up,
knocked on the door, rang the doorbell, called, and I got no answer.
It appeared to me that no one was home.  Further, the missionaries
were supposed to come but I didn't see them.  I left empty handed.
I didn't make this appointment and my companion dropped out today
(which I knew ahead of time).  It gave me the motivation to take
control and start making the appointments.

Work was adequate.  I feel like I am not making much progress on my
current projects.  I also have been writing my monthly notes and
realized that I had a ton of projects which I was working on.  We
also had a team meeting and I was able to talk about about five
different things I have been working on lately.

I have had intellectual interest in learning and using emacs at
work.  However, I have just had the feeling that I shouldn't spend
my time on it.  I have also had moments recently where I have gotten
sick of using Vim's modes in my editing and have wanted a more
straightforward approach which includes the mouse.  However, I ought
to trust my feelings and just stick with the Vim I am using.  On a
positive note, I had a moment today where I was typing Vim commands
quickly and it felt like I was really going fast.

\subsection*{September 5, 2013}

Work was worky.  I feel like I need to devote more time to bigger
projects tomorrow so that I can get closer to completing them.

We had a nice night together.  This morning Allison registered the
car in Maryland; it didn't come out to be as expensive as originally
thought.

\subsection*{September 6, 2013}

At work I buckled down and dug into one of the open-ended projects I
have been given.  I feel like I am slowly making progress on
something.  It's still so open ended that I am not sure what a
desirable outcome is.  We will see what happens next week with it.

We had a nice time today.  Allison watched some kids today as a
favor for a sister in the ward.  In the evening, we went to CVS for
our toodling time.  I told Anna, ``hey!'', when she was wiggling,
and I leaned in as I did it, and she thought that was so funny so
she did it back to me.  Then later, after I drove home, she did it
to me when I took her out of the car.  At bedtime, we read a good
night book where the characters all go up to exercise.  When the
book was done, she said, ``night, night, exercise.''  After singing,
she said, ``be!  be!'' which we realized was her saying that she
wanted to sing ``Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam''.  She is a funny
little girl.

\subsection*{September 7, 2013}

We toodled at Target.  We then went to Potbelly for the first time.
I was too hungry so I actually ordered another big sandwich.  It
ended up being an expensive outing because of the small portion size
of the sandwich.  The food was good though.  We actually bought a
second oreo malt because it was so good.

\subsection*{September 8, 2013}

We went to stake conference today.  It was good to be able to listen
to speakers for a while.  It was also nice to not have to prepare
last night.

We had a usual Sunday around here.  We had some time to video chat
with our respective families.  We went for a walk to the park with
Anna.  We had a nice dinner at home.

\subsection*{September 9, 2013}

We had a good evening.  We ate pork quesadillas for dinner and played
with the rubber ducks during bath time.  We had a very humble Family
Home Evening at about 7 PM.  We spent the evening watching TV
mostly.

In the morning before I went to work, we had family prayer,
scripture study, and breakfast.  I went to work and spent the whole
9 hours on a project I was working on Friday.  I am not sure if this
project really qualifies as making a difference at work; I hope it
does.

\subsection*{September 10, 2013}

We had a nice evening.  We had dinner together.  We were able to
FaceTime with my mom for a bit.  She is not feeling well and will have
to have surgery soon.  I went to church to play basketball this
evening.  It was fine, and I think it is good for me to get out and
meet the other people in our ward.

Work was adequate.  I am hungry to be making a big impact.  I feel
like the past while I have been working too slowly.  We will see how
the rest of the week goes.

\subsection*{September 11, 2013}

Work was fine.  Allison gave me a haircut with the clippers she bought.
It will save us money.

\subsection*{September 12, 2013}

Work was adequate.  I have four projects going right now along with
various other things which I have on my list of things to be done.
I am having trouble prioritizing things and focusing on one thing.
I ended up working a little bit on lots of stuff today, which wasn't
necessarily the best idea.

I am tired.  I keep staying up late studying computer stuff.  I need
to stop doing that.

\subsection*{September 13, 2013}

I went into work early and left early to go to the ultrasound today.
It turned out that Allison was called in because she was measuring
small.  Of course, since we had been through the same thing, we were
sure that the new baby was probably actually big (she was).
However, we found out that she is breach right now, so we are really
praying, especially Allison, that she will turn around so that we
don't have to have a c-section.

Today at work my co-workers had a surprise mini-party for me and my
fellow intern Chris; Chris is getting married next week and I am
having a baby, so we had a getting married cake and a new baby cake.
They also gave me a card and a \$50 Target gift card; my mentor
Katie also knit us a pink baby hat, which was very nice of her.

We had a good evening.  We went to Dollar Tree and bought candy.
Allison made some preparations for Anna's birthday tomorrow.

During scripture study, in 2 Nephi 30, I read about how the Lord
will judge the poor righteously.  I am grateful for what the Lord
has given me temporally.  I am fortunate to have enough money to
care for my family.

\subsection*{September 14, 2013}

Today was Anna's birthday.  In the morning we opened presents---we
didn't get her that much, just a book with animal sounds and an
alphabet puzzle.  We went to the Columbia Mall and did a lot of Anna
things.  First, we let her bring her doll, Dolly, which we never do
because we reserve Dolly for night time.  She played on the play
place.  She went on the carousel; she was very peaceful while she
was on the carousel, but she screamed both when she had to patiently
wait for her turn on the carousel and when she had to get off of the
carousel; she loved it.  We ate lunch at the food court and had
Chick-Fil-A.

In the afternoon we had FaceTime with Anna's grandmas.  We got a
package in the mail today which was a doll stroller from Allison's
parents.  We went to a nearby park and Anna was able to play on the
swing and slide.  Anna took her Dolly in the doll stroller and
pushed her all the way there.  After the park, we went to dinner at
Chipotle and then toodled at Target.  We let Anna ride in the big
cart with the seats for kids to ride along.  Pushing that big
honking cart around was annoying, but we were glad to do it because
Anna enjoyed it.  We then went home to have Anna's ``cake''.  We
realized we didn't have any matches, so Allison went to the grocery
store down the street to buy some.  The cake was actually a cupcake
decorated to look like Cookie Monster.  Anna had fun eating the
cupcake and got blue frosting all over.  We had bath time with all
of her bath toys and then put her to bed with a book, songs, and a
prayer.

I was filled with sadness at the end of the day.  Focusing on doing
all of Anna's things made for a very special day.  I was sad that at
times I let my mind wander off to focus on other things besides
family.  I realized that my time with Anna at this special stage in
her life is actually extremely limited.  I am motivated to do
better.

\subsection*{September 15, 2013}

This morning we went to church.  Our nursery class seemed to go
really well and all of the kids were really good today.

We had a typical Sunday.  We had FaceTime with our families.  We
walked to a park and Anna got some of her wiggles out.  It was a
nice day.

\subsection*{September 16, 2013}

For work, Allison was nice enough to make some homemade salsa as a
thank you for the generous gift card we received last Friday.  I
ended up having a lot of junk food at work today and I came home
without much of an appetite.  When I get bored at work I eat.

At work I struggled with staying on task.  At the end of the day,
fortunately, I was able to get a couple things done, but I
definitely lost some time in the middle of the day.  I am very
driven in this job to make the best use of my time and to get as
much done as possible.  I will do better.

Part of what makes me confident that I can do better is that I have
already been through so much with a mission and with getting a
Ph.D.  I think I have all the tools to use my time efficiently.

We had FHE tonight.  It was very short, but it is important for us
to have FHEs on a regular basis.

I will need to help Allison more and more as she is getting more
tired.  At the same time, her nesting instinct is kicking in, so she
feels a need to push herself to clean and organize.

We had a talk about our laziness.  I ate a ton of junk at work.  We
are generally eating what we want without regard to our future
health.  I have been lazy in my decision making and have been quick
to indulge myself in whatever.  I realize now that by me choosing to
abstain from indulgence, I was lifting the whole family up.  I am
going to do my best to get back on track.  This includes:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Waking early and getting to bed early (on a schedule
		probably).
	\item Studying my scriptures for time (and most importantly paying
		strict attention).
	\item Not eating junk.
	\item Keeping my gadgets off during family time.
	\item Following whatever I feel is the right choice for me at any
		moment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{September 18, 2013}

I went to work a little under the weather, but I wasn't about to
miss any time for it; I am trying to build up time for when the baby
comes and for when we go to Utah for Christmas.

We had a nice night.  We put on the new season of {\it Survivor} and
Allison made a delicious treat with pudding, oreo crumbs---actually,
Allison committed a ``felony'' by buying the generic kind---and
gummy worms.  We also spent the night fascinated by trying to
download the new version of the operating system onto our iPhones
and iPads.

\subsection*{September 19, 2013}

We went to Chipotle tonight; we justified it because Allison got
\$40 today for baby sitting.  It was good.  Anna threw a big fit
though because she wanted ``num nums'' and she didn't understand
that we were going to the restaurant.  When we ate food, however,
she was in a much better mood.

Work was fine.  I was the only one in my cubicle---the three
permanent people were gone.

\subsection*{September 21, 2013}

Tonight we went to a ``luau'' which my home teaching companion and
his wife threw.  It was a nice time and I am glad we were able to
go.

I was thinking about my family and I am full of gratitude for having
such a wonderful family.  I love Allison and Anna so much and I know
that I will love the new baby so much too.  I am grateful that I
have been able to have a good relationship with Allison and that
there have been no obstacles stopping me from just loving my family.

Work was fine.  This week the other three permanent people in my
cubicle were gone and I was left to my own devices.  I feel like I
have come a long way because I was fine this week.  I made good
progress on a bunch of things, including a complete project I was
given.  I still have gaps in what I can do, but I have closed a lot
of gaps in my time in the office.  I even have had the opportunity
to explain how to do some things to the other, newer intern on my
team because I am the only one on the team who learned how to do it.

\subsection*{September 21, 2013}

We went to Target in the morning to buy Anna some medicine.  She has
had a cough and every time she sneezes we have to wipe her nose for
the snot.  I have also been under the weather this week, except I
have gone to work and put in a lot of time.

I took a big nap in the morning and a big nap in the
afternoon/evening.

\subsection*{September 22, 2013}

Anna and I stayed home from church because we were sick.  Allison
was able to get the sister who normally helps with singing time to
stay for the whole time in nursery, which was really nice.  Craig
and Ashley had their baby Benjamin late last night and we were able
to video chat with them and see the new baby.

\subsection*{September 23, 2013}

Work was fine; I am very reticent to ask questions, and at present I
have a lot of unanswered questions, especially since everyone was
out of town last week.  I am still sick.

We had a really nice dinner: steak, fried eggs, black beans with
Brazilian seasoning, and rice.  Yum!

\subsection*{September 26, 2013}

I have been sick over the past few days.  I have still gone into
work every day, I have just left early the past couple days.  Today
I felt that I should have just stayed home but I went into work
anyway and paid the price in feeling sick still.  I feel bad that
Allison has to deal with this right now on top of being really pregnant.

\subsection*{September 27, 2013}

I stayed home from work today.  It was the first day off I have
taken at my new job.  I felt a little odd at first taking the time
off, but really nobody cares.  The downside of not getting to go in
today is that I don't get to hear about how the impending government
shutdown will affect me; I assume, however, that I will be
furloughed if the government shuts down.

I went to Instacare this morning and it turns out that I have
pneumonia.  I would have never guessed.  The doctor prescribed me an
antibiotic.  He said, "you must have felt pretty bad a couple of
days ago." (I felt completely horrible a couple of days ago, so
yes.)

We went to Chipotle following the doctor's visit, and then I stayed
home all day to recuperate.  I should have taken yesterday off too.
I feel really bad about going in yesterday and possibly getting my
co-workers sick with what I had.

\subsection*{September 28, 2013}

I was still sick.  I spent most of the day resting.

\subsection*{September 29, 2013}

I was still sick this morning.  Anna had a little bit of a runny
nose too.  We stayed home together for a second consecutive Sunday.

\subsection*{September 30, 2013}

I worked an 8-hour day.  It was Keith's last day with us; we went to
Dunkin Donuts; he also finally said thank you to Allison for her
meals.

It looks like there will be a government shutdown.  I will not be
working during it and will presumably not get an opportunity to
recoup my losses during that time.

\section{}

\subsection*{October 2, 2013}

The government shutdown yesterday, so I only worked a couple hours
to ``shut down'' and then went home.  It looks likely we will be out
of work for a couple weeks.  Today I just had a full day off.  My
fellow interns got together to play basketball this morning, which
was nice.  I was kind of tired today---I am still recovering from my
illness.  We toodled in the afternoon.  I better take full advantage
of the time I have with my family now.

\subsection*{October 3, 2013}

Another forced day off due to the government shutdown.  I watched
Anna in the morning.  In the afternoon we went to Allison's doctor
appointment.  We then went toodling after that.  We even got
burgers, which I had been craving for some reason.  In the evening
we watched TV.

\subsection*{October 4, 2013}

I was still off today due to the shutdown.  I was able to play
basketball with some of my co-workers.  Other than that, I hung out
around the house.

\subsection*{October 5, 2013}

Today was Saturday and I got to watch General Conference.  What I
was able to watch was great.  I watched Anna for a long stretch
while Allison tended to her sick friend Tabitha.  It looks like I
might still get my pay even though the government is ``shutdown''.
It would then turn into a situation where I will be paid to not
work, which I would be OK with continuing.

\subsection*{October 6, 2013}

Today was the last day of General Conference.  It was very
uplifting.

On Friday night we filled out our forms for ``Fantasy General
Conference''.  I researched it out for about an hour to figure out
what was going to happen.  As it turned out, however, we were the
only ones in all of Allison's family to do it.  So I won by default.

I got a call tonight that I have to go into work tomorrow.  I was
disappointed because I thought I would get another week of
ridiculous free paid vacation.

\subsection*{October 12, 2013}

This week I went back to work.  It turned out I had to go to the
first of the required classes I have.  This class will last for six
weeks.

I am a bit down on the class.  I don't like having to listen to
lectures; I feel I learn better when I can get hands on with
exercises.  In general, work makes me a little bit sad.  On the
other hand, I am grateful for the opportunity to improve my resume
through work experience and building some solid computer skills.

\subsection*{October 14, 2013}

I had a holiday today.  Allison and I went in to have the doctor
attempt to manually flip the baby.  It didn't work.

I am a bit depressed about work.  I hate the stress in the class of
fighting to get computer access.  I offended someone the other day
when I naively tried to jump on their computer while they stepped
out.  I now have to deal with my assumption (perhaps legitimately
true!) that I have crossed that person forever.  I hate the feeling
of other people judging me as ``bad'' in some way.  I also from time
to time think that my tour mentor judges me as anti-social; I have a
hard time sitting with people as they chit chat about non-work
things while I could be getting on the computer and working; I think
that I have not chosen the better part on that one; to be fair, I
really would rather work at work than chit chat, and in that sense I
am who I am; I did the same thing throughout my mission.

\subsection*{October 15, 2013}

I had an OK day at work.  Allison had a rough day and was all worn
out when she picked me up.  We went to CVS to get her cough
medicine, and then we got dinner from Pizza Hut.  Anna was a real
trooper.

\subsection*{October 30, 2013}

We went to the hospital early in the morning. Allison's mother
came in late last night to help us out, and so she was able to stay
home with Anna.  They brought Allison in to the operating room and
gave her a spinal.  They then brought in the doctors and performed
the C-section.  They had a sheet dividing her head and arms from the
rest of her body and so blocking her view of the operation.  The
operation was very quick and they pulled out our new baby.  We had
decided that her name was Leah Charlotte Nelson.  When she came out
she had the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck twice; it turned
out to be a good thing that she didn't flip down because it would
have been very bad; since the C-section was just about done and she
hadn't flipped, it was no problem for the doctors to cut the cord
off of her neck.

Leah measured to be 8 lbs, 3 oz.  She had a good amount of hair on
her head.  Because she was a breach baby, her legs are going to be
bent for a couple weeks as she is used to them being like that.

Allison is motivated to get better from her C-section.  At the end
of the day she already ventured out of bed and sat down in a chair.

\section{}

\subsection*{November 14, 2013}

It has been busy around here.  We had our mothers here in stints:
Allison's mother for the first week of Leah's life, and my mother
for the second.  My mother in particular went out of her way to buy
us stuff.  I slacked of a bit at home because mothers were taking
care of things.  From that point of view I am ready to get on with
real life.

Today was the first day without mothers.  When I came home, Allison
told me that she had had a hard day.  Anna had gotten used to my mom
being here, showing her with attention, and spoiling her.  Allison
also is having a hard time because she hasn't been able to pay much
attention to Anna for the past couple of weeks; as a stay-at-home
mother, Allison has been with Anna all the time prior to the birth
of the second one, so it was a shock to her to be apart from Anna.
Anna was in ``destruction mode'' and was being ``sneaky''.

When I first came home, Anna was really grumpy when I turned off the
TV.  She even cried for my mom (``Deet'') at one point.  As the
night progressed it got better.

\subsection*{November 15, 2013}

We had a nice night.  We went to Chick-Fil-A and Target.

At work, my six-week class had its last day today.  I am excited
actually to get back to work and do some good work on some of my
outstanding projects.  I also have a quandry with picking my next
assignment.  During my class I heard a lot of people saying that
they already had lined up their next assignments in places that I
was considering.  This gave me the impression that I was too slow to
pick where I was going to go because places may be full already.  I
actually e-mailed one of the places and they are full.

\subsection*{November 16, 2013}

We had a low key Saturday.  We went to the library in the morning
and went to Target in the afternoon (that makes two days in a row
that we have gone to Target).

\subsection*{November 17, 2013}

We had a good day at church today.  Allison was set apart for her
new calling as Relief Society first counselor.  We had our video
calls with our families.  We finally did a video blog of the past
three weeks, which mostly consisted of catching up and telling
Leah's birth story.

\subsection*{November 18, 2013}

I went back to my regular office to work for the first time in
almost seven weeks (the government shutdown put an extra week on
it).  It was kind of a grind to work on some of the projects I had
been doing before I left.

I got an email back from an office I had asked about for my next
assignment and they said that they had a cancellation for January
and that I could claim a spot.  I didn't get a reply email back, but
it looks like I could get that assignment.  It will be something
which uses math, as opposed to my current assignment, which has been
a lot more computer programming based.  I am still not 100\% certain
that this is the right office for me, so I guess things are to be
determined.

\subsection*{November 22, 2013}

We had a good week.  Leah gained a whole pound and an ounce between
her weekly checkups.  I had the privilege of going to the checkup
this week.  Allison went out for the first time with both kids on
Thursday; she took me to work, and then during her day she went to
resiliency training.

Work was pleasant.  I was able to remember everything about how to
do things and work quickly and efficiently.

\subsection*{November 23, 2013}

We had a nice day.  In the morning I took Anna to the park and we
went on the slide, the swing, and rolled down a hill.  In the
afternoon we went to Target, Qdoba, and some other stores.  We had a
nice evening.  Both little ladies were in the bath at the same time.
We had our usual bedtime routine with Anna, and we turned in early.

\subsection*{November 24, 2013}

We had a nice day at church.

\subsection*{November 27, 2013}

Work was adequate.  I hit a lot of snags on my projects.  I am
trying to work hard but I am also coming up against a lot of
frustration.

We went to Chick-Fil-A and Target tonight.

\subsection*{November 28, 2013}

Today was Thanksgiving.  My co-worker Tim invited us to partake in
Thanksgiving at his house in Baltimore.  It was a really nice time.

\subsection*{November 29, 2013}

I went to work today.  There were not that many people there.  It
was nice to have solitude.  It was lousy because I had put off the
most boring tasks of my week until Friday.  Oh well.

Tonight we decided to go out to eat.  I suggested that we try Jersey
Mike's, which we had not been to in Maryland.  We drove out to the
one in Bowie, and when we got there, they had a sign on the door
saying they were closed due to a power outage.  Anna flipped out
that we were turning away from ``num nums''.  She was inconsolable
until we finally drove up to Chick Fil-A (her favorite).  We went to
a different location from our usual, which worked out seeing that it
was ridiculous to go twice in one week.

\subsection*{November 30, 2013}

We had a nice Saturday.  We had the sister missionaries over for
dinner.  Anna and I went to the library in the early afternoon
before they got there to bring back books and to give Allison time
to prepare.  Also, in the evening the elders dropped by randomly to
visit with us.

\subsection*{December 1, 2013}

We had a nice day at church.  I got a jolt of motivation to be
better.  I followed through with that motivation this afternoon.  On
past Sundays I had given in to temptation to check on football
scores; really this habit is ridiculous for a lot of reasons, not
the least of which is that tackle football is a dangerous game that
I would never want my children to play competitively.  My personal
experience with goal setting, personal resolutions, and self
improvement is that it boils down to desire.  I haven't encountered
any tricks to make myself keep commitments other than just wanting
it bad enough.  When I am doing well, I can feel myself beating down
the urge to be lazy or to indulge myself.

I followed this to have a nice night.  By being disconnected from
distractions, I was able to minimize Anna's TV time and maximize our
shared family time.  I was even able to spend some nice time with
Allison tonight.  With her hectic routine of taking care of two
children, I am not going to get time with Allison unless I
disconnect myself from lesser concerns and make the effort to spend
time with her.

\subsection*{December 2, 2013}

I checked out a book from the library the other day.  I spent some
time early in the morning---I took a really long Sunday
nap---reading from it.  It had a very interesting discussion about
college choices.  In essence, it showed evidence that being one of
the best students at a mediocre school is better than being a
mediocre student at a great school.  It has made me rethink my own
feelings on my school choice.  Perhaps I was served well by being
one of the best students at mediocre schools.

Another thing I thought about in connection to the book was how
feeling like an underdog at work has made me try a lot harder.  I
have really been striving hard to do what I can to get better.

\subsection*{December 6, 2013}

I had an OK workweek.  I am still struggling with being lazy.

\subsection*{December 7, 2013}

In the morning Allison got the emissions checked.  Then we all went
to clean to church.  Then we went home, changed, and went back for a
baptism.  Then we came home for nap time.  This afternoon the
Smith's kindly dropped by their old table, which we will now use to
replace our current table, which was too tall and was uncomfortable
to sit at.  We went to Target to get a few things, then we went back
to church for the ward Christmas party (it was quite a churchy day).
We came home and put Anna through her night routine.  In the evening
we watched the movie {\it Sneakers}---that is, I watched it, Allison
fell asleep during it.

\subsection*{December 9, 2013}

Work was fine.  I started a new small project and of course it is
hard to get into a new project but I think I am going to be able to
do OK with it.

At night as we were putting Anna to bed, we were leaving her room
and she started throwing a tantrum and saying, ``Pooh back!''  She
doesn't have a Winnie the Pooh doll or anything like that; after a
minute I came back into her room.  I realized that she saw a Winnie
the Pooh wipes case in her room and she wanted me to put it back in
Leah's room where it usually is.  She has the funniest personality
sometimes.

\subsection*{December 10, 2013}

Today was a snow day at work, so I was able to stay home, which was
nice.  Allison was able to go to a appointment for Leah to get an
ultrasound on her hip while I stayed home as Anna napped.

\subsection*{December 12, 2013}

I worked an 8-hour day and came home.  Allison had a relief society
activity to take part in and help out with, so I stayed home with
Anna and put her to bed.

\subsection*{December 15, 2013}

On Saturday we flew to Utah to start our vacation.  We landed in
Salt Lake and my mom came and picked us up.  Today, Sunday, we went
to church.  We then spent the rest of the day hanging out.

\subsubsection*{Funny funnies}

Anna drank her sacrament cup slowly.  I tried to hide the empty cup
but a minute later she found it.  She looked around in confusion to
find the tray where it went.  She eventually saw some deacons a few
rows over, so she escaped from our row, walked over, put the cup
back in a tray, and came back.  (I got her after she had put in her
cup.)

\subsection*{December 16, 2013}

We hung out today.  I am trying to be a better person.

\subsubsection*{Funny funnies}

Here are some of the latest funniest funnies: Anna saying ``candy
canes'' (``ca-ca-canes...''); Anna being jealous of my mom giving
other babies attention (she is never jealous when either I or
Allison is involved.)  Leah being super smiley.

\subsection*{December 20, 2013}

We have been spending family time in Utah with my family.  On
Wednesday I was sick, as was most of the family.

\subsubsection*{Funny funnies}

We had pizza and Anna blurted out, ``I love pizza''.

\subsection*{December 22, 2013}

We had Leah's blessing today.  Most of my Provo area family came, as
well as Allison's parents and sisters.  It was an adequate day.

\subsubsection*{Funny funnies}

Anna saw a bug on the kid's room window and said, ``bug!''  Allison
said, ``oh, goodness!'' and Anna said, ``oh, goodness!''.

\subsection*{December 24, 2013}

We had our usual Christmas Eve celebration.  It was a
very nice time with the family.  Anna really warmed up to my
extended family, sang some songs, jumped around, and gave out some
hugs and kisses.  My mom and Paul were generous in their gift giving
towards us.  I received, per request, a set of the new edition of
the scriptures.  I honestly have not had the best year of studying
the scriptures.  I know that the scriptures are true and that it is
eternally beneficial to study them; I know that I have benefited in
this life from studying them.  However, I have faltered and not
studied them.  Further, I know very well that getting a nice set of
scriptures will do nothing in the long term to change my habits; I
must rededicate myself to being better.

\subsection*{December 25, 2013}

We drove in the morning via rental car to St.\ George.  I was
grateful to my mom and Paul for the nice time we had with them.  I
was also grateful for a job which allowed us to have an extended
break with them.  I am grateful that I currently have a job which
gives me a lot of flexibility.  If I had a hypothetical situation
where I was a professor, I would not have had such a long,
easy-going trip; I may have been able to have had about as long a
trip, but it would have been filled with work.

Christmas with Allison's family was nice.  We received generous
gifts of money and gift cards.  Anna and Leah got some nice toys and
clothes.

\subsection*{December 27, 2013}

We went to Las Vegas.  It turned out to be a boring girls' trip.  I
was appreciative of the time I spent with my beloved immediate
family.

\subsection*{December 28, 2013}

We had a Target toodling trip in the early afternoon with a Cafe Rio
lunch.  In the afternoon we went to the DI so Allison could shop for
skirts, and we picked up Chick-Fil-A for dinner (or as Anna likes to
call it, ``Num Nums Moo Cow'').  We had Cannon and Cohen over in the
evening.

\subsubsection*{Funny funnies}

Colleen was watching Anna and they were looking for Dolly.  Colleen
said, ``Dolly\ldots'' and Anna said, ``where are you\ldots''.

\subsection*{December 29, 2013}

When I was getting ready for church today, I tried to put on my
recently dry-cleaned pants and they were too tight.  The zipper
broke.  I didn't have any last minute replacement pants, so I had to
stay home from church and miss the blessing of the new niece baby
Jesse.

I'm embarrassed that I broke my pants; it is because I have let
myself go.  I am very upset by my inability to have a good diet.

\subsection*{December 31, 2013}

Today was my last day in St.\ George.  We went out to eat at places
of my choosing.  Allison, Anna, and Leah are staying until January
6, and I am sure going to miss them.  I enjoyed being able to spend
so much time with my family during this break.

I got on the shuttle at 8 PM down to the airport, got through to my
flight, and started on my way home.

\section{}

\subsection*{January 1, 2014}

I arrived at the airport at about 6:30 AM.  I took a shuttle home
which cost less than \$30, although it was a long wait for a shuttle
to arrive.

I spent the day napping and relaxing.

\subsection*{January 2, 2014}

I had my first day back at work.  It was a bit like I never left.
In the evening, I was able to video chat with my family, who I miss.

\subsection*{January 3, 2014}

There was a delayed start to the work day because of the snow.
However, I got inaccurate information from the notification message
in my voicemail inbox, and so I went in at 10 when really I should
have shot for 1 PM.  At any rate, I was really bored this morning
since my family is still in Utah, so it was not a bad thing to be at
work early, and actually, I was able to declare no lunch because
technically I didn't have to be there until 1.  Now that today is
done, I only have two weeks left, so I am in a rush to get
everything on my plate done.

At night I was bored other than the opportunities I had to video
chat when Anna was going to bed and when Allison was going to bed.

\subsection*{January 4, 2014}

I decided that I would make some real food for my Sunday dinner.  I
went and bought a big pork butt from Food Lion.  I researched pulled
pork crock pot recipes.  I then thought about barbecue sauce.  We
have a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's, but I decided I wanted to do
something beyond that.  I thought about making my own, or
replicating the Old Bay BBQ sauce from Mission BBQ (it would have
been easy: get BBQ sauce and add Old Bay seasoning), but I settled
on trying to replicate Phil's BBQ sauce.  I found on the Internet
that Phil's BBQ sauce is similar to a sauce called Open Pit.  I
learned that the sauce is sold at Safeway grocery stores in the
area.  I got the sauce and it does taste similar to Phil's sauce.

\subsection*{January 5, 2014}

I went to church this morning.  It was good, if not a little lonely
without my family.

I made pulled pork in the crock pot.  I made some slight mistakes in
the pulled pork.  It also took too long and I ended up filling up on
cereal, so I wasn't hungry for it by the time it was done anyway.
It was probably a failure, but a learning experience.  The silver
lining is that I will eat my own terrible food, so the food will get
eaten.

\subsection*{January 10, 2014}

My family came home on Monday.  It was exciting to have everyone
home.

I had an adequate week of work.  This week was my second-to-last
week of work in my office.  I made some friends over the course of
my time in the office, so I am really grateful for that.

\subsection*{January 11, 2014}

We went to Costco this morning.  It was pouring rain when we left.

The afternoon we went to a co-workers house and had a nice time with
his family and another co-worker's family.  I was happy to have had
such a nice time with friends.

\subsection*{January 13, 2014}

I went to work today.  I am in my last week of my office; I am just
trying to be in a wrap up stage.  I will be excited to start in my
new office and dig into some new topics.

We had a good dinner and a short and sweet family home evening.
Allison called Verizon and it looks like I will be able to get a
government discount for our service (hopefully---it sounded like
there was a good possibility of being hosed in the usual Verizon
style).

Lately Anna has been taking off her diaper in bed.  Tonight she took
it off and peed the bed.  We had to take Dolly away from her because
she was soaked, which was really rough from Anna; however, we need
to teach her not to take off her diaper, and so we decided to let
the natural consequences stand.  (We have two spare Dollys which we
did not get out.)

\subsection*{January 29, 2014}

We bought a van a couple weeks ago.  We named it Blue Diamond
Phillips.  I hope that it works out for us.  It has been a big
relief for Allison to not have to be home all day.  It would be
onerous for her to have to take me into work when she wanted the
car, especially since we have two little ladies now, and since I am
at a location twice as far from my previous location.

I am in the second week of my new office.  I am still figuring out
how I will have success in this assignment.  Unfortunately, the
first week or so of the assignment I didn't get a lot of sleep.  I
have been feeling the ill effects from it, and have been a little
bit sick.

\subsection*{January 30, 2014}

We went to get a computer update for the van.  Allison thinks that
the van is now running a lot better.  We still are looking at what
to do with the jammed cd player.

I need to do better at doing important things first.  I just have a
lot of stress from trying to succeed at work and from being tired
when I come home every day.

\section{}

\subsection*{February 2, 2014}

Allison was officially called to be the Relief Society president.
She is going to have a lot of work ahead of her in her calling.  We
had a pleasant Sunday.  In the evening, we stopped by one of my work
friend's houses for his Super Bowl party.  We only stayed an hour
because of bed times, and because Allison had a meeting to talk
Relief Society with the outgoing president (and because of the
Sunday-ness of it all).  However, I was glad to have been included
in the party and we had a nice time.  It also turned out that the
Seattle Seahawks, football team of my childhood, won the big game;
for me personally, it is partially muted by (1) football being an
excessively violent game which I have mixed feelings about and (2)
my trying not to emotionally involve myself in the outcome of
sporting events because to me it is irrational to do so.

\subsection*{February 3, 2014}

We had a delayed start to the day because of a forecast of snow.  It
ended up just raining and not snowing, but we still had a delayed
opening.  I ended up working for only three hours today.  In the
morning, I got to spend time with the family.  When I got home from
work, we had FHE; the lesson was on saying sorry, and we colored and
made bracelets out of what we colored.  I think Anna enjoyed it all.

\subsection*{February 6, 2014}

We had a nice night tonight.  Anna has gotten into climbing on my
back and playing horsie.  She also has been learning how to say some
prayers by herself, which has been good.  Leah is as smiley as ever.
She has been a really good baby.  Allison has been pretty busy
during the nights now that she is the Relief Society president.
Work has been fine lately.

\subsection*{February 10, 2014}

We had a nice dinner, went to Costco, and then had a family home
evening about whispering.  Anna loved coloring for our activity and
focused on it for quite a while.

I went in an worked a 10-hour day today.  I am trying to save up
some time for when my mom gets here.  I pretty much spent my day
trying to solve math problems, which is a pretty tough thing to do.

\subsection*{February 12, 2014}

We had a nice night at home.  I gave Anna a lot of horsie rides, her
new favorite thing; it is exhausting though.  Leah was in a really
good mood and was smiling and singing along with Allison tonight.
We are planning on all staying home tomorrow as there is a snow
storm which started tonight and is predicted to continue into
tomorrow morning.

Work was a bit lackluster.  One of my flaws is that I don't like to
talk to other people, so I let lingering doubts about what to do
with my time fester.  I am also a little bit caught up in spending
time trying to solve the few open research problems I have seen
instead of buckling down and producing work---not that I know what
``work'' means in my situation.

\subsection*{February 13, 2014}

I had a day off from work for the snow storm.  We didn't leave the
house.  I spent some time working on a question Prof.\ Helton sent
me a few weeks ago.  It was kind of a waste of time because it took
a lot of effort to try to solve the problem, but I am in a job, not
academia, and so it was time spent on something which will not do me
much good.  In my ideal scenario for the day, I would have been able
to develop skills and gain knowledge related to my actual job.  I
was not able to do that however.

\subsection*{February 14, 2014}

I only had to go into work for three hours today because of
inclement weather.  In the morning we spent time as a family.  We
went to Chick-Fil-A for lunch.  In the evening, we dropped Anna off
at a babysitting activity at the church (which was a fundraiser for
the scouts) and then went to dinner at Mission BBQ (which was
delicious).  It was a good day.

As for work, I am very cognizant that I am going to have to be
completely dedicated to have success in my chosen field of endeavor.
I have lofty goals for my current tour of duty, but I have a lot of
courage to go after them.

\subsection*{February 15, 2014}

We went to Target in the morning and had fun.  Today I was feeling
more dissatisfied with my slothfulness than usual.  Part of this was
that Allison said she was feeling overwhelmed with her
responsibilities.  I cleaned the kitchen in the morning and most of
the downstairs in the early afternoon.  I cleaned a chunk of the
bedroom and did a lot of laundry.  I haven't done laundry really
since we moved and I started my job.  I realize that I need to do
more for (1) doing my fair share but also for (2) helping Allison
have time to do her calling.  There is also the issue of me trying
to be successful at work through diligence, which requires me to not
be slothful as well, but today that was secondary to being a good
husband and father.

In the afternoon, my coworker friend Tim dropped off his daughter
Adelaide for babysitting.  We will be doing some babysitting trades,
so I was glad that we were able to do that.  The girls had a lot of
fun playing.

\subsection*{February 16, 2014}

Church was good.  Anna always is excited to go to nursery and
participate in everything that goes on there.  I had a good lesson
about strengthening the family.  I need to make sure that I give my
family my full attention when I am home with them.  Allison had a
crazy time in her calling, so I was glad to be able to support her.
As usual, we were able to video chat with our families.

\subsection*{February 21, 2014}

I had an adequate week.  Allison had a busy schedule with her
calling.  I made some small progress on work stuff, so that is
somewhat encouraging.  I had intentions of building up some extra
time at work for when my mom comes, but I had a hard time waking up
early; basically, I struggle when I don't get adequate sleep; also,
I haven't been making it to bed until Allison goes to bed.

\subsection*{February 23, 2014}

I had an adequate day today.  I feel a little bit down.  I know that
I am doing lousy at being social with people; actually, in some
settings (church being the biggest example) I just choose to not be
social at all.  I at least need to improve on my social skills at
work (I am doing the best at work out of any outside place, but my
career would be greatly benefited by good social skills).  I can
also tell that Allison is irritated at me about being ``down''.  She
hates dealing with it, and that actually makes me irritated back at
her.

\subsection*{February 24, 2014}

Today was Allison's birthday.  I made Allison a breakfast in bed of
eggs, bacon, and toast.  Actually, I made enough for all of us and
Anna had breakfast in bed too.  I went to work for a full day.
After work we went to Outback Steakhouse.  We had a good meal.  Then
we came home and I made Allison some cupcakes with a raspberry
buttercream frosting.  They ended up being a lot of work, but they
turned out OK.  I sure hope Allison had a good birthday.

\section{}

\subsection*{March 8, 2014}

We went to the National Zoo with my colleague Tim and his daughter.
It was nice to get out and have Anna have some fun.

\subsection*{March 9, 2014}

Church was good.  Allison gave a talk.  Anna had a good time at
nursery, as always; in nursery, her favorite toy is the airplane;
she is also attached to the Noah's ark animals; the teachers have
been giving her extra snacks because before she was finishing her
portion quickly and then stealing other peoples' snacks.  As a
summary of what has been going on lately, we are doing well.  Leah
came in underweight at her pediatricians check-up visit.  She needs
to eat for longer periods of time apparently.  Anna is doing well.

\subsection*{March 15, 2014}

I had a tiring week.  Daylight savings was Sunday, so I lost an hour
of sleep.  Further, I woke up earlier than usual and worked longer
hours than usual.  Allison had a busy week at nights.  She is
actually feeling sick today.

\subsection*{March 23, 2014}

We had a good day at church.  As always on Sundays, we had good
video chats with our families.  I am motivated to do better in
everything.  As for a summary of this week, I got really tired by
the end of the week.

\section{}

\subsection*{April 14, 2014}

I have been slacking on a lot of things lately.  I am definitely in
the down part of my usual cycles.  I am sick of being such a
slacker, but of course it is hard to stop.

I have a wonderful family.  Allison is so good to me.  I am really
proud of all that she does to help our family and in doing her
calling.  We have two wonderful girls, Anna and Leah.  I am so
blessed to have them in our family.  I hope to be a good dad to
them.

\subsection{}

\subsubsection*{May 2, 2014}

We watched Adelaide tonight.

To catch up on things, I agreed to go to New Jersey this summer for
10 weeks for work.  It is going to be difficult to be away from
family for so long.  From a work perspective, it is a great
opportunity, and it should be fun.  From a family perspective, it
seems like a mistake to do; I don't know what Allison will do
without me.  I also later agreed to go to New Jersey for a week this
month; we will see how things go at home.

\subsubsection*{May 3, 2014}

We had a good Saturday.  We went Adelaide's birthday
party in the morning.  In the afternoon, we watched William; we went
to Costco and Chick-fil-a, and he seemed quite miserable to be going
with us; I felt bad, but really I should have done more to help.

I was thinking on my life around the time of my interview which led
to my current employment.  I recall a spiritual impression which,
according to my vague recollection, led me to keep doing math
research.  I also recall that I felt like my math research at the
time didn't really click with me until I was applying for jobs and
was graduating.  In my current opportunities, I am really feeling
grateful that I have the confidence and experience to do math
research because I feel that has really been a big boost to me.

\subsection{}

\subsubsection*{June 22, 2014}

We had a pleasant Sunday.  Church was good.  We had video chats with
family.  Anna recently caught on to Dr.\ Seuss; every time we call
my mom now she wants to read \emph{Ten Apples up on Top}.

Unfortunately, I agreed to do a ten-week program for work in New
Jersey.  I had to leave tonight to get to my Residence Inn hotel.
It is about a $2 \frac{1}{2}$ hour drive.

\subsubsection*{June 23, 2014}

I had my first day of summer work.  I was a little under the weather
today.  I was more overwhelmed than I had anticipated.  On the other
hand, I will be able to continue some of the projects I had been
working on.

I had to go shopping for some extra items I needed.

I was able to chat with Allison and the kids a lot today.

\subsection*{June 24, 2014}

I went to work, chatted with family, and made my own dinner
(again---I am avoiding restaurants to save money).

Work was adequate.  I still am nervous and worried about what I will
be able to contribute.

Anna had a bloody nose tonight and bled profusely.  I was really sad
for her and disappointed to not be able to be there to help.

\subsection*{June 25, 2014}

I went to work a little bit early.  I don't think many people come
in early.  I had an adequate day of work.

They are having a tour tomorrow, so Allison came up tonight.  We
took the girls swimming in the hotel pool.  I literally just walked
back and forth in the pool with Anna as she floated on her elephant
float toy.  Allison went around with Leah.  Both seemed to enjoy it.

We didn't have easy sleeping arrangements for those two.  We had
pack and plays for both.  Leah was tired by about 8 PM, and she had
no problems sleeping.  Anna was distracted when we tried to keep the
lights on and play cards.  When they stay in the future, we probably
won't get to do much while we are trying to get Anna to bed.

\subsection*{June 28, 2014}

I drove home from New Jersey last night.  We had a day with family,
going to Costco, Target, and Chick-Fil-A.  We also watched some kids
for a family that is moving.

\subsection*{June 29, 2014}

We had a nice church meeting.  Unfortunately, I had to take Anna
home early because she had a blowout.  Also unfortunate was that I
had to drive back to New Jersey for another week of work.

Allison sang Anna ``Nighty Day/Morning'' instead of ``Nighty
Night''.  Anna thought it was so funny.

\subsection*{June 30, 2014}

I went into work, took no lunch, skipped unnecessary talks, and
stayed a little late.

\section{}

\subsection*{July 1, 2014}

I had a tiring day of work.  I changed my hotel reservation so that
I will be checking out tomorrow.  In the evening I felt tired but a
little bit sick; I had trouble falling asleep.  At home, my mother
and Paul came to visit; unfortunately I was not there for the first
day of seeing them.

\subsection*{July 10, 2014}

Last week, I had a good time at home with family.  I spent Wednesday
through Sunday with my mom and Paul visiting.  It was also good to
not think about work during that period.

I came back to New Jersey on Sunday night.  I have a new hotel room
which has an inferior kitchen but is much closer to the parking lot.

I have been missing my family.  Allison, Anna, and Leah went to St.\
George for Crystal's wedding.  Unfortunately I felt that it would be
too much to go to it.  Instead, I get to put in a full day of work.

\subsection*{July 11, 2014}

I had an adequate day of work.  It is going to be weird this weekend
to stay in the hotel and have to fill my days with non-work
activities.

Allison, Anna, and Leah went to Crystal's wedding today.  My mom was
able to come down too and watch the kids while Allison attended the
sealing.  I was sorry to miss it.

It turned out that while the wedding dress was in Allison's parent's
bedroom after the festivities, Anna found a blue sharpie in a
drawer and drew a big blue line on it.  Allison was beside herself
about it.  I feel bad about the situation too, but I also know that
Anna doesn't know what she is doing.

\subsection*{July 12, 2014}

I had had plans to do some extra studying on this Saturday, but I
felt not to do so.  I didn't have anything better to do, so I
basically loafed around my hotel room all day.  I did think about
math problems for a while.

\subsection*{July 13, 2014}

I decided to go to a Spanish branch for my church.  I only went to
sacrament meeting today, although next week I will probably attend
all the meetings.

I decided to take out some time for scripture study.  I studied some
recent essays the church has put up on its website about some more
controversial issues.  I thought it was a valuable study; it seems
important to be able to respond to questions other may have about
the church of this form.  Further, I would like to affirm here in my
journal that I know that the church is true.  I have received
countless witnesses of the spirit during my short life of the
truthfulness of various aspects of the gospel, including the {\it
Book of Mormon}, which is the word of God.

\subsection*{July 14, 2014}

Unfortunately I got off to a lazy start today and I woke up after 8
AM.  I had an adequate day of work.  That took up most of my day.

\subsection*{July 19, 2014}

I spent the Saturday thinking in my head about a math problem for
work.  Being away, I feel some responsibility to take advantage of
the free time to be productive.  I was able to come up with a
solution which I will pass from my brain to the computer on Monday.

\subsection*{July 20, 2014}

I went to all three hours of a Spanish branch.  If I was alone I
think I would just go to Spanish branches---I really like them.

\subsection*{July 21, 2014}

I had an adequate day of work.  I did laundry in the evening.
Allison is flying home tomorrow with the little ones.  It will be
good to see them this weekend.  In the meantime, I have been
spending large chunks of my free time thinking about work; since I
have made the sacrifice to be away from my family and come out here
for work, it seems right that I should take my free time and make my
sacrifice count.

\subsection*{July 22, 2014}

I had an adequate day of work.  I was tired when I got home from not
sleeping well lately.

\subsection*{July 23, 2014}

Adequate day of work.  I signed up to feed missionaries in the
Spanish branch here, and it turned out that the missionaries in
Princeton are sisters; we had an adequate meal at Bobby's Burger
Palace next to the hotel; it would've been better with elders.

\subsection*{July 24, 2014}

Adequate day of work.  Will be glad to go home for the weekend.

\subsection*{July 27, 2014}

I had a good time at home with my family.  It seems like it was a
mistake to agree to 10 weeks away from home; at least I learned my
lesson.  Anna was very happy to see me; a couple times she told me
that she liked seeing me.  Leah was scared to see me, I think
because I had a big beard from not shaving for 3 weeks.  But I ended
up having a great time with both daughters.

On Saturday we went swimming.  It was really fun.  We also went on a
date night while Anna and Leah were at my friend Tim's house.

Church today was good.  I was asked Saturday night to prepare a
short testimony about pioneers for the meeting; my testimony was
therefore very brief; I almost prefer giving a talk because I feel I
have time to really put my thoughts together.  I had Leah during the
meetings and she was just as happy as can be; she is a ridiculously
happy girl.

Leah really loves seeing a tape measure extend and retract.  We also
had fun playing with the wind up duck we call ``Waddles''; she got a
huge kick out of him.

I get complementary jelly bellies at the hotel, so I brought some
home; Anna was really into those.

\subsection*{July 28, 2014}

I had an adequate day of work.  Leah was sick at home with a big
fever; Allison said that she read that one needs to treat the
symptoms and not the temperature, and so even though her temperature
exceeded 104\textdegree.

\subsection*{July 29, 2014}

It appears that Leah (a.k.a.\ Squish Squash) has
recovered from her fevers.  Our prayers have made a difference.

Leah was given the nickname of ``Squishy'' by Allison because she
makes a squishy sound when she army crawls due to her umbilical
hernia.  Anna, in her two-year-old way, has given variations on
this.  Anna's variations are mostly ``Squash'' or ``Squashy'', but
the other day she called her ''Squish Squash'' which we thought was
funny.

I had an adequate day of work.  I have expressed a variation on the
following thought in earlier days, but I will re-express it here to
emphasize how much more prevalent it has become.  When I get home
from work, since I am without my family, I frequently spend a lot of
time thinking about work.  At the beginning of my time away I
remember that I was watching a lot of ESPN and otherwise relaxing.
As I have gotten into projects at work, I have spent a significant
amount of free time thinking about those projects; I have made
progress my thinking things out in my head; as I have made progress
while away, I have been encouraged to think things over further.  As
I have sacrificed time with family to be away for this work
opportunity, I am trying my best to take advantage of it.

\section{}

\subsection*{August 1, 2014}

I had a ``worky'' day of work.  I basically spent all day filling
out my performance evaluation forms.  It probably turned out as well
as expected given my lack of experience with this stuff.

I also decided to extend my stay in New Jersey through tonight so
that I would have extra time to fill out my forms at work.  In
hindsight, it may have been more advisable to leave tonight.

\subsection*{August 3, 2014}

I had a good weekend at home.  We had a very busy Saturday and a
nice Sunday of church.  I continue to regret my decision to take on
10 weeks of work away from home.  Anna seemed to be trying hard to
make a connection with me during my time home; she would often ask
to do things together with me; at the end of my time she asked me if
I had fun.  It made me sad to have to leave the poor little lady for
another week.

\subsection*{August 4, 2014}

I had a ``worky'' day of work.  I had some of the free hotel
dinner---I haven't taken advantage of that feature enough during my
stay.  Allison has had Disneyland on the brain.  We are going to try
to go to Disneyland and San Diego for a few days during one of my
vacations.  Anna has been starting potty training in more
earnestness.  She has had some success.  In the past days she has
told Allison that she needed to go to the potty, and she has gone.
We have been sending her messages about going to the potty for
months and months, and so it appears those messages have finally
sunken in.

\subsection*{August 5, 2014}

Another day, another day of ``work''.  Anna continued her potty
training at home.

\subsection*{August 6, 2014}

Work.  Anna was able to make good progress on potty training today.

\subsection*{August 12, 2014}

This past weekend I enjoyed spending time at home with my family.
Anna has been really good at going to the potty.  Leah has been
enjoyable; she has a funny ``cackle'' which she lets out when she
gets her hands on something she wants.

I have about three weeks left of my time away.  I don't think it was
worth it to sacrifice time with my family to be out here.  That's
all I will say about that for now.

\subsection*{August 13, 2014}

I had another work-filled weekday away from family.  I have been
appreciative that at least I have been able to talk through video
chat.

\subsection*{August 14, 2014}

Worky.  Was able to video chat with my beloved family.  Will go home
for the weekend tomorrow.

\subsection*{August 23, 2014}

This weekend my family came to New Jersey to spend the weekend with
me.  Today we went to Philadelphia and visited the Please Touch
Museum.  They had a lot of things which were really fun for Anna.
We had a great time.  We then went to get a cheesesteak at Pat's,
the original Philly cheesesteak place.  We were really worried about
getting a parking spot; Allison said a prayer to herself to find a
spot; as we pulled up a spot opened up right in front of the
restaurant.  We were sure blessed.  We then were in a frenzy as we
we noticed we were almost out of gas; fortunately we found a spot.
Back at the hotel, we went swimming in the swimming pool (a favorite
of Anna's).  All in all, we had a pretty good day.  I was very happy
to have spent the time with my family.

\section{}

\subsection*{September 2, 2014}

This past Friday I came home from New Jersey for good.  What a
relief to finally be home.  I probably won't be doing much travel
away from my family in the future.

Church was good this week.

On Monday my friend Tim invited us over to his house for a barbecue.
It was a good time.

Today I went to work.  I am starting a class about things outside my
current set of interests.  The past year of work has inspired me to
want to do mathematics; I have made some good progress on this, but
it appears that I will have to fight really hard if I want to make
it my career.

The other day Anna woke up around 4:30 crying.  Allison went in to
see what the problem was and she proclaimed that she wanted
Chick-Fil-A.

\subsection*{September 8, 2014}

I had my performance review comeback.  It came back average (if not
slightly below average).  I was somewhat disappointed in this.  I
felt like I had been doing some really exceptional work lately.  I
have come back down to earth and re-evaluated what I am doing at
work.  I have been lately dreaming of really getting into
mathematics research; the only issue with that is that it is more
competitive than average; further, there just may be no research
spots open when it is time for me to try to get a permanent
position.  I have given more thought to planning to get another job;
I would like to live in San Diego/somewhere closer to home; this
would save a lot of money on travel, be a better time zone for
keeping in touch with people, etc.

\section{}

\subsection*{October 18, 2014}

I have not been diligent in writing in this journal.  I have missed
a lot of stuff.  In September Anna had her third birthday.  My
mother was able to fly in for the occasion.  Anna got a scooter and
some other things from my mom, a.k.a.\ Deet.

I have gained a lot of weight; my clothes have not been fitting
well; I have a big belly now.  Today I have started a diet
to try to push my weight down.

I have started a new tour of duty at work.  In this instance, I have bit off
maybe more than I can chew; really I have no background in the things which I
will be doing.  I am in a place that I previously had imagined I would want as
my future permanent place of employment, but after the first two weeks I am
highly doubtful that this is what I will end up doing.

\subsection*{October 19, 2014}

Today I woke up after the first day of my extreme diet.  I think cutting out
(artifical) sugar has made me have a lot more energy.

We had a nice day of church today.

\subsection*{October 21, 2014}

I have been going to work; mostly it's just been learning.

\subsection*{October 27, 2014}

I am still dieting.  I am seeing how it is really hard to lose
weight.  It has not seemed sufficient to just cut out sugar to have
the pounds drop off of me.

\subsection*{October 30, 2014}

Today was Leah's birthday.  I went home from work a little bit early, but I was
so tired from having stayed up late while my mom has been here that I had to
take a nap.  We went out to eat and went to the store this evening.

We are sure glad to have Leah in our family.  She is a very happy baby.

\subsection*{October 31, 2014}

This morning I took my mom to the airport.  We were grateful to have her visit
our home this week.

This evening we went trick-or-treating with my co-worker Tim's family.  Anna was
a bumblebee and Leah was a ladybug.  Anna kept wanting to stop early---she
wanted to start eating her candy; she had no concept that she could just build
her stash.

\section{}

\subsection*{November 3, 2014}

Still dieting.  It is going slowly.  There is sugary food everywhere
waiting for me to eat, and I just have to abstain from it.

\subsection*{November 12, 2014}

I am still dieting; I have not been taking cheat days.  I will be
excited when my 30 day period is over.

\subsection*{November 13, 2014}

The van battery died, so we had to spend time getting it replaced
this morning (well, mostly Allison).  We have done some grown-up
level puzzles lately.  It turned out that we have had a Mario puzzle
for quite some time.  Anna was excited to ``help'' do it, so we have
been working through it these past couple of days.  (I actually did
it all in a day, so we are re-doing it.)

I also went to the Amish market today, as I have been doing on a
mostly weekly basis, and I got a lot of chicken wings, as I have
been doing during my low-carb extreme diet.  As far as the things I
am dreaming of eating at the end of my diet, I think Amish market
donuts rank pretty high on my list; also of note is cookies and
cream cookie butter from Trader Joe's.

\subsection*{November 14, 2014}

I had an adequate day of work.  A lot of my day at work has been
spent learning.  I am hopeful that I am going to get to the level I
need to be at where I can really do some good work.

We continued the Mario puzzle tonight.

\subsection*{November 18, 2014}

Yesterday we had the van in the shop for repairs.  We had a scare in
the morning because the tow driver delivered it to the wrong place.
Fortunately, it was eventually located.

\subsection*{November 21, 2014}

I had my last day of work before vacation.  I suppose I am feeling
stressed out about work.  My style is to never ask questions if I
can avoid it, for better or worse; what happens sometimes is that
my assigned project mentors can often just let me be.  I suppose
part of my stress is that I need more feedback than I am getting.
Another factor in my stress is just the pressure to succeed; I
haven't produced anything in my office and I have already spent
about two months there; I am going on vacation, so that will be
three months.  Oh well.

\subsection*{November 22, 2014}

Today was Saturday.  We got ready for our trip to Utah and
California.  I had a ``cheat day'' for my diet, which I am planning
on for Saturdays; I took Anna to the Dutch Country Farmer's Market
to get some donuts.  We watched Adelaide in the afternoon to
evening.

\subsection*{November 23, 2014}

We had a good day of church today.  In the evening we cleaned and
packed.

\subsection*{November 24, 2014}

We flew to Utah to start our Thanksgiving vacation.  We arrived at
my mom's house at the end of a long day.

At the beginning of the day, I decided to do an hour of work.  It
seemed like a waste; oh well, now I know.  We were fortunate enough
to get a ride to the airport from Allison's friend Amber.  As we
were making our way through airport security, the power went off.
It was an unusual situation and we sat in limbo for an hour plus.
Fortunately, we eventually made our way over to our flight not to
long before it left.  On the flight, we had lots of space: we had a
full row to ourselves.  As we left the airport, we were stopped by
someone who told us we lost our (Leah's) shoe; it turned out we also
left her carseat, so we were fortunate to catch that.  All in all it
was a successful trip.

\subsection*{December 5, 2014}

We flew home from our vacation.

The first phase of the vacation was spent in Utah.  For the first
week, we spent Monday through Thursday in Springville at my mom's.
We then spent Friday and Saturday in St.\ George.  We had a good
time catching up with family.  We had a nice Thanksgiving and
Allison's mother's show was a success.

We drove to California the second week on Sunday.  The traffic was
slow since it was the Sunday after Thanksgiving; it took us around
10 hours to get from St.\ George to Anaheim.  We spent Monday at
Disneyland.  We had a nice time there.  Some highlights were the
teacups, the gadget go-coaster, and meeting Mickey and Minnie.

We then drove to San Diego for the rest of the week.  For me, it
gave me a greater sense of peace about not living in San Diego
anymore.  I realized that Allison misses San Diego much more than I
do as she has more friends and a greater sensitivity to the weather.
For me, although I didn't realize it, I have already moved on with
life.  I think to a point Allison had a similar feeling.

\subsection*{December 6, 2014}

Allison did a lot of work for the ward Christmas party today.  It
was a success as far as I can tell.

\subsection*{December 9, 2014}

I have been going to a (local) work conference this week.  Next
week, I take off again for two weeks of vacation.

\subsection*{December 11, 2014}

At work I gave a talk; it was OK, not great.  I went to the Dutch
Country Farmers Market with people from work.  Traffic was slow and
I didn't get in enough time with the girls tonight.

\subsection*{December 12, 2014}

Went to my last day of work before our Christmas trip.  I played
pirates with Anna.

\subsection*{December 13, 2014}

We had a fine Saturday.  I watched the girls by myself as Allison
went to the temple this afternoon.

\subsection*{December 14, 2014}

We went to church today.  It was good.  In the evening, we
accompanied Allison as she made deliveries to sisters in the ward.

\subsection*{December 15, 2014}

We started our Christmas vacation.  We made the long flight from
Maryland to Utah.  The girls did fairly well on the flight.

\subsection*{December 20, 2014}

I have had a cold the past few days.  I am hopeful that I will be
better in the next day or two.  Unfortunately, I think Allison is
coming down with it now.  It also seems like Leah has had it as long
as I have had it.

\subsection*{December 29, 2014}

Yesterday I flew home from Utah; my family stayed and will come home
on the $6^{\rm th}$.  Today I went to work.

\subsection*{December 31, 2014}

I got to bank an extra three hours day because it is the day before
a holiday.  Tomorrow I don't go to work.  I am missing my family.

\section{}

\subsection*{January 3, 2015}

I haven't really done much with my time other than go to work.  I
can't seem to find the balance between being busy and relaxing.

\subsection*{January 4, 2015}

I went to church alone today.  It was good.

\subsection*{January 8, 2015}

On Tuesday my family came home.  I was very happy to see all of
them.

Tonight I had food poisoning.  It was not fun.

\subsection*{January 9, 2015}

I only was able to put in 6 hours of work as I was still recovering
from food poisoning.  I came home and took a big nap.  I then had a
good time with the girls at bedtime.

\subsection*{January 11, 2015}

We went to church this afternoon.  It was good.

\subsection*{January 13, 2015}

Allison was sick so I was only able to have a half day at work.  It
was pretty inconvenient because I felt I needed to be there to be in
the loop, but it had to be.

\subsection*{January 29, 2015}

I missed three days of work while Allison was sick.  Lately, I have
just been doing my normal thing.  Today we went to Allison's
appointment and saw the new baby on the sonogram.

\subsection*{January 30, 2015}

End of a work week.  It looks like our ward will be split and
Allison will soon be released from her Relief Society president
calling.  She learned a lot but is relieved to not have the huge
responsibility.

\section{}

\subsection*{February 1, 2015}

At church today we had a stake-wide meeting where the wards were
realigned.  We are part of a small section which is being separated
from our military ward to a new ward.  As mentioned, Allison will be
released from her big calling, so she should have more time on her
hands now.  I think this ward change will work out OK.

\subsection*{February 5, 2015}

Good week at home with family.
``Worky'' week of work.

\subsection*{February 7, 2015}

Laid back Saturday.  The girls stayed home as they are not quite
feeling well.  I went to the Dutch Country Farmers Market and got us
some pretzel-related items.

\subsection*{February 10, 2015}

Anna has been sick for the past few days.  Allison took her to the
doctor today and she has an ear infection.  Hopefully taking
antibiotics will make her feel better.

\subsection*{February 17, 2015}

This weekend the whole family has been sick to some degree.  Leah is
getting in her molars.  I had a snow day today.

\subsection*{February 23, 2015}

Tomorrow is Allison's birthday.  I have been scrambling to put at
least something together for it.

\section{}

\subsection*{March 1, 2015}

We had a nice day at church.  Allison started her new calling as
Primary president.

\subsection*{March 4, 2015}

My mom came to town yesterday.  We are enjoying having her spend
time with us.

\subsection*{March 9, 2015}

Sent my mom home today.  We appreciated having her.  She really
helped us out with the girls and was in general very generous.

\subsection*{March 10, 2015}

Worky day of work.  Had fun with the family after work; I am being
more conscious of the need to spend quality time with Anna and Leah.

\subsection*{March 20, 2015}

I have been working pretty hard at work.  I didn't get a lot of
sleep last night.  Otherwise trying to spend time with the family.

\subsection*{March 22, 2015}

We had a good Sunday.  I am just trying to enjoy time with the
girls.

\subsection*{March 25, 2015}

We bought another big tub of jelly bellys from Costco because the
girls get a kick out of eating them with us.

\section{}

\subsection*{April 4, 2015}

I am winding down my current work assignment.  I don't think it is
going well.  I have learned a lot, but I am not going to come out of
with with wonderful results.  It has been stressful.

\subsection*{April 5, 2015}

We had a easter treasure hunt with the girls for their easter
basket.

\subsection*{April 10, 2015}

We have a month left before our San Diego vacation.  Leah had a
meltdown tonight and we were really worried about her; we thought
that maybe she needed to go to the doctor because she was in pain,
but she calmed down on the way there and was fine.  At nights I have
been playing the ``matching game'' with Anna.  I like the idea of
her exercising her brain and also following the rules of a game.
Often she doesn't really focus on the game and is mostly just lost
in her own little world.

\subsection*{April 22, 2015}

We finished watching the TV series \textit{Psych} last night.

\section*{}

\subsection*{May 31, 2015}

This month we went on a three week long vacation.  The first week I
went to a work conference in San Diego, and the family came with me.
The second week we went to Springville to spend time with my mom and
family.  The third week we went to St.\ George to spend time with
Allison's family.

\end{document}
