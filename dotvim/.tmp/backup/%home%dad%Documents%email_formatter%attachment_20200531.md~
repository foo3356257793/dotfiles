# <span style="color:#FF2079;font-size:larger">All about YW Camp</span>

Its been a long road to get from the first covid cancellations to the robust virtual camp plan that we now have in front of us. But I have been blessed to work with some amazing young women and women, and we have followed inspiration. I wanted to send you an update of what is planned so far.

Each YW will be assigned to a group. Groups will have from 8&ndash;11 YW total. Each group will be led by 2&ndash;3 Youth Camp Leaders (YCLs), who are older YW. These YCLs will be led by a Youth Camp Director, these are the amazing young women who have been attending our camp meetings, Kassidy, Virginia, Abigail, and Milly.

The weekend before camp, camp bags will be delivered to the YW with a t-shirt, a schedule, materials for classes, and other camp goodies! We hope for your help delivering these bags.

# Plan

Each day we follow the same basic formula:

## MORNING

**8:00/8:15/8:30&ndash;9:00 am**. Optional exercise class

**9:00&ndash;10:30 am**. Whole camp opening exercises, then group activity time, then group scripture time.

**10:30&ndash;11:00 am**. Personal scripture time (offline).

## AFTERNOON

**2:00&ndash;3:00 pm**. Whole camp enrichment class, learning about growth, resilience, mental health and such.

**3:00&ndash;4:00 pm**. Break-out classes. Each day there will be five options. These are crafts, skills, games, and projects that they will do in smaller sets. In about a week we will send out a questionnaire to YW. They can tell us which classes they would like to do, and weâ€™ll make up their schedule, as close as we can to what they requested (just like school!).

## EVENING

**7:00&ndash;7:30 pm**. Optional Camp Songs

**7:30&ndash;8:30 pm**. Whole camp Meeting

**8:30&ndash;9:00 pm**. Group Goodnight

<br />


Camp is going to be amazing this year.  I am grateful to
be a part of it.

 Love, Sister Higley
