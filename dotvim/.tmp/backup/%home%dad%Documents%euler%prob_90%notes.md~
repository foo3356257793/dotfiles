# How to do this?

Need at least one $0$.
Choices:
 1. Both $0$
 2. One $0$

In Case 2, this forces $1,4,[9]$ onto the other cube.

For each digit we have the following choices:

  1. Both cubes
  2. One cube
  3. No cube (only for 7)

Each face of the cube must be different.

**Idea**.

Generate choices for cube 0.  (Less than $8$ bits.)
