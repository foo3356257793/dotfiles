Hello friends! You’re receiving this email from us because we love and appreciate our friendship with you (and we also happen to have your email address.) Since we have all been disconnected from so many things this past year, we thought it would be great to make 2020 the first year in our ten year marriage that we send out a Christmas card (albeit a little late and virtual). Also, since we don’t post on social media, we thought this would be a way for you to catch up with our family.

After living in Odenton, Maryland for three years, in June 2016 we were fortunate enough to move from Maryland back to where it all began: San Diego! (No, literally, we moved back just three blocks down the street where we lived before moving to Maryland in the first place.) We loved every minute of it! Between the wonderful neighbors and friends we made, the proximity to family, the kids’ wonderful teachers, the perfect weather and the In-N-Out burgers, we were living in the sun!

Unfortunately, our three-year stay in San Diego came to an end but fortunately we were able to find another great place to live: Severna Park, Maryland! On August 25, 2019, after spending a month visiting family and traveling across the country, we arrived back on the east coast. In order to ease our transition back, we decided to rent with the plan of finding a home to buy after a year. After living in our home for a time, the opportunity arose to purchase the house and we couldn’t resist. In August 2020, we purchased our home with the biggest perk being that we didn’t have to move! We love the house, our friends, our church community, our school and teachers and the proximity to Cafe Rio. It was meant to be. Severna Park is now home for us for the foreseeable future.

Anna is 9 years old and in the third grade.  She loves sloths, cleaning and organizing her room, designing her dream zoo, and dreaming of what animal we can get as a pet.  She is always coming up with elaborate stories like of a farmer at Kinder Farm Park who had too many turkeys so he had to send one home with us.  In her dreams we'd have pet sloths, foxes, turkeys, hamsters and fish, just to name a few.

# Leah

Leah is 7 and in the first grade. If you can't find her, she's probably in her room making a perler bead creation or reading her Geronimo Stilton books.  She also loves to craft and would spend all day doing it if she had the chance. She recently had a project at school where she designed a house for the three little pigs out of random things around the house, and she was in her element designing and constructing it.

# Sam

</center>

Sam is five and missed the kindergarten cut off by one day so instead of virtual kindergarten, he's able to attend Stacy's School, a wonderful preschool out of the home of a friend of the family. Sam is a problem solver.  If there is something he wants or needs---like the stapler in the cupboard above the stove, for example---he will figure out how to get it.  It's a blessing and a curse, and we hope that he uses his drive and tenacity only for good in his lifetime.

# Julia

Julia, a.k.a. Juju, is 3 and also attends and loves Stacy's School. On Thanksgiving for her thankful turkey she said she was thankful for elephants, hide and seek, tickling, hugging, messing with dad and dancing which describes her very well.  She lives and sleeps in her tutus and princess dresses and is happiest when she's snuggling you "just a lot" or leaping and twirling around the house.

# Allison & Chris

Allison, between the watering and feeding of the family, has discovered an unexpected love of digital design and crafting. She got a cricut machine last year and has been attending the University of YouTube to learn how to use it.  She has also enjoyed working with the young women in church. Next year holds the possibility of all four kids being in school so she also spends time dreaming of how she could possibly spend her free time.  Spoiler alert: the first item on her list is a nap!

Chris is still employed as a mathematician and is doing who knows what at work.  All we know is he's gone for 40 hours a week and he gets a paycheck every two weeks so he must be doing something important. His other full time job has been to maintain the landscaping of our yard.  During the height of fall, it was a daily endeavor to keep the leaves at bay.  This second "job" has allowed him to put on his music and podcasts and zone out so he doesn't mind so much the work.

We call this year the year we stayed home. We didn’t travel to see family at all and there were even a couple months during the summer Chris didn’t have to go into work. The kids have grown to be best buds (and yes, sometimes best enemies) and Chris has even dabbled in cooking. We’re making the best of it but hoping for more in-person connections (and in-person school) next year.

We thank you all for your friendship and we hope you are well and happy! We wish you the very best in 2021!

Love,

The Nelsons <br/>
