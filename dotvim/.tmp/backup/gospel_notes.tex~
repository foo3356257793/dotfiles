\section{Abrahamic Covenant}
\label{sec:abrahamicCovenant}

\subsection{The Covenant}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item ``I will make of thee a great nation'' (Abr. 2:9)
 \item ``thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their
hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations'' (Abr. 2:9)
\item ``in thy seed after thee$\ldots$shall all the families of the earth be
blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of
salvation, even of
life eternal.'' (Abr. 2:11)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What does it mean?}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item I am a part of a ``great nation'' of believers.
 \item I hold the priesthood, and further, I served a mission in which I
``bore'' the priesthood to others.
 \item I have the gospel, and further, I served a mission in which I brought
the gospel to others.  Another thought is, as mentioned by Elder McConkie later
in these notes, this has to do with eternal families. {\it Note:} in some way
it will be to our salvation to be linked as a large eternal family.
\end{enumerate}

\

Another thought: patriarchal blessing.

\

There is something in God making a special covenant with Abraham.
He must honor that covenant. (Although, note that He wouldn't make a covenant
He didn't wish to make.)  Where are all the places where God makes a special
covenant with people?  How can we receive a ``special covenant''?

\subsection{Historical Timeline}

\begin{itemize}
 \item The covenant started with Abraham, was passed down to Isaac, then Jacob
(i.e. Israel), then Joseph.
\item Moses freed Israel from Egyptian bondage
\item Israel split into two: Ephraim (or Israel) in the north and Judah in the
south
\item 721 B.C. Ephraim is taken by the Assyrians and lost
\item Christ comes through Judah
\begin{itemize}
 \item Gen 49.10
 \item Gen TJS 50:24
\end{itemize}
\item Today we are the ones who have the Abrahamic covenant: 3. Ne. 25-26
We need to do missionary work to gather those of ``Israel''.
\item In the last days there will be two cities
\begin{itemize}
 \item New Jerusalem (Ether 13:3-6, D\&C 84:1-5)
\item Jerusalem
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Millennium}

Handout: ``O Youth of the Noble Birthright''

Ten tribes to return during the Millennium (Millenial Messiah p. 251).
Physical return to Palestine (Millenial Messiah p. 319-321; also note on A of F
10).


\subsection{Malachi 4:5-6}

\begin{quote}
 Mal 4:5-6: Elijah to return to ``turn the heart of the fathers to
the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers''.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Moroni (to Joseph Smith): ``And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the
promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their
fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his
coming.''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Bruce R. McConkie: ``Both of these translations are correct$\ldots$Taken
together,
they give us an expanded and comprehensive view of the mission of Elijah that we
would not gain from either of them alone.'' (The Millenial Messiah, p. 266)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Joseph Smith: ``He shall reveal the covenants of the fathers in relation to the
children, and the covenants of the children in relation to the fathers.''
(Teachings, p. 321)
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Bruce R. McConkie: ``Who are the fathers?  They are Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
to
whom the promises were made.  What are the promises?  They are the promises of a
continuation of the family unit in eternity; of posterity in numbers as the dust
of the earth and the stars in the firmament; of eternal increase; and of the
consequent glory, and honor, and exaltation, and eternal life inherent in such a
way of eternal existence.''
\end{quote}

\subsection{Land of Canaan}
\label{sub:landOfCanaan}

\begin{quote}
 God gave ancient Canaan to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the twelve tribes of
Israel, of whom the Ten Tribes are the dominant part.  It is their land, in time
and eternity.  It is their land now whenever they are worthy to tread its
blessed surface.  And it shall be theirs again in that everlasting eternity that
lies ahead.
Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{The Millenial Messiah}, p. 322
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The President of the Church is the only person on earth at any
given time who does or can exercise these [meaning the keys of the gathering of
Israel and the restoration of the ten tribes] or any other priesthood keys in
their eternal fulness.  He will direct the return of the Ten Tribes.  It will
not come to pass in any other way.
  Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{The Millenial Messiah}, p. 323
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
 ``$\ldots$the great day of the return of the Ten Tribes, the day when the
assembling
hosts shall fulfill the prophetic promises, shall come after the Lord's
return.'' (Also from Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{The Millenial Messiah}, p. 323,
I think.)
\end{quote}

\section{Adversity}

\subsection{Persecution of Prophets}

From Notes, 2009.01.04
\begin{quote}
``Persecution is an essential part of the creeds of all false religions.''
(\textit{The Mortal Messiah} 2: 317)
The preaching of the gospel brings peace to the righteous and brings sorrow to
sinners; the gospel divides men.
When we receive the prophets, we receive a prophet's reward.
\end{quote}

Note 2009.01.09

\begin{quote}
	When you are going through something hard, ask yourself, ``Is this going
to matter a year from now? Is this going to matter 10 years from now?'' Most of
the time the answer will be no.
\end{quote}

Note 2009.02.01
\begin{quote}
	The Lord gives us trials to prepare us for things we are supposed to
do.
\end{quote}

\section{Agency}

(From a district meeting on my mission)

\begin{itemize}
 \item Gen. 49:3-4: Unstable as water
 \item Matt. 6:24: No man can serve two masters
 \item Rev. 3:15-16: Lukewarm
\end{itemize}

\section{Apocrypha}

\textit{Wikipedia}, ``Old Testament``, accessed 2010.07.12

\begin{quote}
The contents of the Old Testament canon vary from church to church: the Orthodox
canons have 51 books, while the major Protestant communions have 39.
\end{quote}

\textit{Wikipedia}, ``Biblical Apocrypha``, accessed 2010.07.12

\begin{quote}
This usage originated in Luther's Bible of 1534, which was the first to print
the Apocrypha as a separate inter-Testamental section. Luther was making a
polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this
division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the
Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were
not received as canonical.
\end{quote}

\textit{Bible Dictionary}, ``Apocrypha``

\begin{quote}
Apocrypha. Secret or hidden. By this word is generally meant those sacred books
of the Jewish people which were not included in the Hebrew Bible (see Canon).
They are valuable as forming a link connecting the Old and New Testaments, and
are regarded in the Church as useful reading, although not all the books are of
equal value. They are the subject of a revelation recorded in D\&C 91, in which
it is stated that the contents are mostly correct, but with many interpolations
by man.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Books of the Apocrypha}

\textit{Bible Dictionary}, ``Apocrypha``

\begin{quote}
 Among these books the following are of special value:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The First Book of Esdras
\item The Second Book of Esdras
\item The Book of Tobit
\item The Book of Judith
\item The rest of the chapters of the Book of Esther
\item The Book of the Wisdom of Solomon
\item The Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, or Ecclesiasticus
\item The Book of Baruch
\item The Epistle of Jeremy
\item The Song of the Three Children
\item The History of Susanna
\item Bel and the Dragon
\item The Prayer of Manasses
\item The First Book of the Maccabees
\item The Second Book of the Maccabees
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\section{Apostasy}

\textit{Guide}, ``Apostasy''

\begin{quote}
``A turning away from the truth by individuals, the
Church, or entire nations.''
\end{quote}

\textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 33, ``Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel in Every
Dispensation``
(my numbering added):

\begin{quote}
``All people have the gift of agency, which includes the freedom to accept or
reject the gospel as taught by the prophets and apostles.  Those who obey are
blessed, but those who (1) ignore, (2) reject, or (3) distort the gospel do not
receive God's promised blessings.``
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Great Apostasy}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Amos 8:11-12: A ``famine$\ldots$of hearing the words of the Lord.``
\item 2 Thes. 2:1-3: The Great Apostasy is predicted
\item Isa. 24:5: People would change the gospel
\item 1 Cor. 1:10-13: Paul was asking for unity
\item Acts 20:28-30: Prophecy of apostasy
\end{itemize}

\textit{Preach My Gospel},, p. 36, ``The Great Apostasy``
\begin{quote}
``Investigators must understand that a universal apostasy occurred
following the death of Jesus Christ and His Apostles.``
\begin{itemize}
 \item ``The Church of Jesus Christ is built on a foundation of apostles and
prophets``
(Eph. 2:19-20; 4:11-14).
\item ``People rejected and killed Jesus Christ and the Apostles`` (Matt. 24:9,
1
Ne.
11:32-34, 2 Ne. 27:5).
\item ``$\ldots$many conflicts of doctrine arose.``
\item ``Throughout history, many people have sincerely believed in false creeds
and
doctrines.``
\item ``Therefore, a restoration, not a reformation, was required.``
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Three Apostate Reactions}

(Based on a study from my Gospel Journal)


Three apostate reactions are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ignore
 \item Reject
 \item Distort
\end{itemize}
\textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 33 (as quoted above)

\subsubsection{How do people today do these things?}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Ignore}: Be slackers. ``If I don't know the truth, I can't be
punished for not following it.'' ``One God, many religions.''
 \item \textbf{Reject}: Argue the gospel with members of the church; ``Bible
bash;'' speak badly
about the church, picket it, etc.
\item \textbf{Distort}: Believe in and or distort false doctrines (this kind of
apostasy occurs
from within).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How did this sort of thing occur in Christ's time?}
Hard to say since the gospel spread so quickly (perhaps a study could be made on
this?)
Persecution of the church.
False doctrine was taught.

\subsubsection{How do we personally ``stop the apostasy?''}
Search the scriptures, both the standard works and the words of the living
prophets; listen to church leaders, both general and local authorities.
Be obedient to our leaders and to God's commandments.
Base our personal beliefs directly on the scriptures and on the words of the
prophets, not on any contradicting personal opinions we may have.

\section{Ark of the Covenant}

If one Google's it, one can find people who say that the Ark of the Covenant
had such destructive power because it conducted electricity.

\section{Atonement}

Ezra Taft Benson, ``The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants,''
\textit{Ensign}, May 1987, 83

\begin{quote}
``Just as a man does not really desire food until he is hungry, so he does not
desire the salvation of Christ until he knows why he needs Christ.
No one adequately and properly knows why he needs Christ until he understands
and accepts the doctrine of the Fall and its effect upon all mankind. And no
other book in the world explains this vital doctrine nearly as well as the Book
of Mormon.''
\end{quote}

\noindent Joseph Smith, \textit{Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith}, selected
by Joseph Fielding Smith, (1979), p.121

\begin{quote}
``The fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles
and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again
the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to
our religion are only appendages to it.''
\end{quote}

	Note: I have often heard this referred to as saying the Atonement is the
main principle of our religion and that all other principles are only appendages
to it.  For example, see Jeffrey R. Holland, ``Missionary Work and the
Atonement,'' \textit{Liahona}, Oct 2001, 26.  I concur that what the Prophet
meant here was the atonement.

\

\noindent Tad R. Callister, \textit{The Infinite Atonement}, p. 128
\begin{quote}
	If suffering is proportionate to one's physical, intellectual,
spiritual, and emotional sensitivities, then the Savior suffered more than
mortal man, because he knew more, felt more, and cared more than any other
mortal had ever done.
\end{quote}

\noindent Alma 7:11-13:
``He suffered all of our infirmities so that he would know how to succor us.''

\

\noindent Gospel writers suggest that the suffering continued on the cross.  In
\textit{The Mortal Messiah}, Elder McConkie says, ``Could it be that this was
the period of His greatest trial, or that during it the agonies of Gethsemane
recurred and even intensified?''

\subsection{Atonement in the {\it Book of Mormon}}

After going through the index, I found the word ``atonement'' or
used in reference to the atonement of Jesus Christ in 17
chapters of the {\it Book of Mormon}, ``atone'' used in 4 others,
and ``atoning'' used in 1 other.  This count excludes of course
places where the concept of atonement is discussed but the
vocabulary word atonement is not.  The {\it Book of Mormon} has 22 +
33 + 7 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 29 + 63 + 16 + 30 + 1 + 9 + 15 + 10 = 239
chapters, so we get a form of atonement in 22/239 = 9.2\%  of all
chapters.  The {\it Book of Mormon} has the concept of the atonement
in it.

By contrast, the October 2013 General Conference had a form of the
word atonement with reference to the Atonement of Jesus Christ in
16/35 = 45.7\% of talks.  I wouldn't expect this number to match the
{\it Book of Mormon} total.

\section{Baby Blessings}

``Priesthood Ordinances and Blessings,`` \textit{Family Guidebook}, (2006)

\begin{quote}
``Every member of the church of Christ having children is to bring them unto the
elders before the church, who are to lay their hands upon them in the name of
Jesus Christ, and bless them in his name'' (D\&C 20:70). In conformity with this
revelation, only worthy men who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood may participate
in naming and blessing children. The ordinance of naming and blessing children
requires authorization from the presiding authority.

When blessing a baby, men who hold the Melchizedek Priesthood gather in a circle
and hold the baby in their hands. When blessing an older child, brethren place
their hands lightly on the child's head. The person who gives the blessing:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Addresses Heavenly Father.
\item States that the blessing is given by the authority of the Melchizedek
Priesthood.
\item Gives the child a name.
\item Gives a priesthood blessing as the Spirit directs.
\item Closes in the name of Jesus Christ.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}


\textit{Encyclopedia of Mormonism}

\begin{quote}
BLESSING OF CHILDREN. When babies are just a few weeks old, they are usually
given a priesthood blessing for the special purpose of conferring a name by
which the baby will be known and bestowing promises based on spiritual
impressions regarding the baby's future life. A quality of prophecy attends this
process. If a baby's father is a worthy holder of the Melchizedek Priesthood, he
will usually pronounce the blessing, but it may be given by a grandfather, a
family friend, or any other qualified priesthood holder chosen by the baby's
parents. Babies are usually blessed in the presence of the congregation at a
fast and testimony meeting. However, the blessing may be given at other times
and places, such as in a hospital or home, if there is a special need.
\end{quote}

\section{Baptism}

``Covenant'', \textit{BD}

\begin{quote}
``Sometimes denotes an agreement between persons (1 Sam. 23: 18) or nations (1
Sam. 11: 1); more often between God and man; but in this latter case it is
important to notice that the two parties to the agreement do not stand in the
relation of independent and equal contractors. God in his good pleasure fixes
the terms, which man accepts. The same word is sometimes rendered ``testament.''
	``The gospel is so arranged that principles and ordinances are received
by covenant placing the recipient under strong obligation and responsibility to
honor the commitment. Thus the severe consequences to Ananias and Sapphira, who
deliberately broke their covenant and lied unto God (Acts 5: 1-11).''
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Baptismal Covenant}

We promise:
\begin{itemize}
 \item To be ``willing to take upon [oneself] the name of the Son''
 \item ``always remember him''
 \item ``keep his commandments'' (Moro. 4:3)
\end{itemize}

God promises:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Constant companionship of the Holy Ghost
 \item Remission of sins (Acts 2:38)
 \item Being born again (John 3:5)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baptism Performed Only After the Age of Accountability}

\begin{itemize}
 \item D\&C 68:27: Children are baptized when they are eight
 \item Moro. 8: The false doctrine of infant baptism is condemned
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Baptism Needs to Be Performed by Proper Authority}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Mosiah 21:53: ``[they] were desirous to be baptized; but there was none
in the land that had authority from God.``
\item Acts 19:1-6: Paul re-baptizes some people when he finds out they didn't
receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands
\item D\&C 22:1-4: ``enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded, and seek not
to counsel your God``
\item Pres. Ezra Taft Benson, PMG p. 109:
 ``$\ldots$ The only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether
\textit{The Book of Mormon} is true. For if \textit{The Book of Mormon} is true,
then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a prophet
receiving revelation.''
\item Christ was baptized by proper authority; He showed us the example in being
baptized (2 Ne. 31:7) and taught baptism after His resurrection (3 Ne. 11:17-28)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{How authority is received}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Heb. 5:4: ``called of God, as was Aaron''
 \item Exo. 4:14-16: Aaron was called through the prophet, Moses
 \item Num. 12:6, 8: ``If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make
myself known unto him in a vision''
\end{itemize}

\section{The \textit{Book of Mormon}}

Gordon B. Hinckley, ``A Testimony Vibrant and True,'' \textit{Ensign}, Aug 2005,
2-6

\

\textit{On the challenge to read The Book of Mormon by the end of 2005:}
\begin{quote}
	``Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe
this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read
the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added
measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in
obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of
the Son of God.''
\end{quote}

Marion G. Romney, ``The Book of Mormon,'' \textit{Ensign}, Aug 2005, 8-11

\begin{quote}
``I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of
Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children,
the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell
therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration
for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will
counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more
responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will
increase. Faith, hope, and charity---the pure love of Christ---will abound in
our
homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.``
\end{quote}

\subsection{The \textit{Book of Mormon} Answers the ``Questions of the Soul''}

Ezra Taft Benson, ``Flooding the Earth with The Book of Mormon'',
\textit{Ensign}, Oct. 2005, p. 61; also Oct. 1988 Conference

\begin{quote}
``Missionaries need to know how to use the Book of Mormon to arouse mankind's
interest in studying it, and they need to show how it answers the great
questions of the soul. Missionaries need to read with those they teach various
passages from the Book of Mormon on gospel subjects.''
\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Questions I received on my mission}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Why can't I get a girlfriend? 2 Ne. 2: there is opposition in all things
 \item Why aren't we all equal? 2 Ne. 2: there is opposition in all things
 \item When is the Second Coming? What will happen then? 1 Ne. 22
 \item Christ was born of a woman? Alma 7 (v. 9-10): yes
 \item What does Christ expect of me?
 \item Why is the world so agitated? 2 Ne. 2: there is opposition in all things
 \item Why am I here in the U.S.A.? 1 Ne. 13: this is a blessed land
 \item Is it wrong to drink beer? Mosiah 22: story where drinking had bad
consequences; 2 Ne. 2:27: we are free to choose right from wrong
 \item What is God? Alma 22: v.10: the Creator; v. 12: He gave us His image; v.
18: we must abandon our sins to know him
 \item Is adultery forgivable? Alma 39: yes, if you repent
 \item Why do some people have more than others? 2 Ne. 2: there is opposition in
all things
 \item How should baptism be performed? 3 Ne. 11: v. 23: repentance; v.
25: authority, v. 26: by immersion
 \item If a person is living in sin with another, and dies, will that person be
saved? Alma 42: v. 3: we know right from wrong; v. 13: repentance, v.
16: opposition; v. 22: God would cease to be God without opposition; v. 24: the
truly penitent will be saved
 \item Will there be sadness in Heaven? 3 Ne. 28: v. 7: the Three Nephites would
be more blessed; v. 9: their sadness would be only because of the wickedness of
the world; v. 10: their joy will be complete
 \item How can I use my talents to serve the Lord? Moro. 6: v. 4: after baptism,
they were in the church; v. 5: what the church did
 \item Will I die soon? Alma 12: v. 27: it was declared that all men must die
 \item Where did God come from?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \textit{Book of Mormon} answers questions in two ways}

\textit{from my missionary study journal}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item It answers the great questions of the soul
\begin{itemize}
 \item Morm. 8:35: Mormon saw us: ``I speak unto you as if ye were present``
 \item 2 Ne. 9:50-51: ``feast upon that which perisheth not''
\end{itemize}
 \item It responds to objections or doubts
\begin{itemize}
 \item If The Book of Mormon is true, then the church is true and we have a true
and living prophet at its head.
Knowing this, we know that we must listen to and follow the prophet
The \textit{Book of Mormon} is tangible evidence of this.
\item Ezra Taft Benson, as quoted in \textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 108-109
\begin{quote}
 $\ldots$ All objections, whether they be on abortion, plural marriage,
seventh-day worship, etc., basically hinge on whether Joseph Smith and his
successors were and are prophets of God receiving divine revelation $\ldots$

$\ldots$ The only problem the objector has to resolve for himself is whether
the \textit{Book of Mormon} is true.  For if the \textit{Book of Mormon} is
true, then Jesus is the Christ, Joseph Smith was his prophet, The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is true, and it is being led today by a
prophet receiving revelation.

Our main task is to declare the gospel and do it effectively.  We are not
obligated to answer every objection.  Every man eventually is backed up to the
wall of faith, and there he must make his stand. (\textit{A Witness and a
Warning}, p. 4-5)
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The \textit{Book of Mormon} and Families}

Henry B. Eyring, ``A Discussion on Scripture Study,'' \textit{Ensign}, Jul 2005,
22-26

\begin{quote}
Through the Book of Mormon the Lord can also teach us about being with and
serving people. This book reveals the will of the Lord for family life in a way
that the other scriptures don't even approach. I believe that is largely because
of its interesting structure. It's about families; it's about people's
relationships. It starts with families, it ends with families, and we come to
love these families.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The \textit{Book of Mormon} in the \textit{Bible}}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Ps. 85:11: ``Truth shall spring out of the earth''
 \item Isa. 29: 4, 11, 18: A ``sealed'' book (JS-H: 1:64-65)
 \item Ezek. 37:19: The ``stick'' of Joseph/Ephraim and the ``stick'' of Judah
(Gen. 49:22-26, Deut. 33:13-16)
 \item John. 10:16: ``other sheep''
 \item Rev. 14:6: ``an angel$\ldots$having the everlasting gospel to preach''
 \item Why? There was an apostasy (Amos. 8:11-12)
 \item John 21:25: ``there are also many other things which Jesus did ``
 \item 2 Pet. 1:20-21: ``no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation''
  \begin{itemize}
   \item The Book of Mormon is not a ``private interpretation'' of the
scriptures but is a
book of writings of ``holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost.``
  \end{itemize}
 \item Heb. 13:8: Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{A Bible! A Bible!}

2 Ne. 29

\begin{itemize}
 \item v. 4: The Bible is a record of the Jews (only)
 \item v. 7-8: God communicates and has communicated with other peoples
 \item v. 9: God is the same today as he was yesterday
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why do people believe only in The Bible?}

\textit{from my missionary study journal}

\begin{quote}
The Bible is actually true.  This is in contrast to many churches and pastors
who are not true.
The Bible is something many people, including parents, have in common. There
isn't really anything else comparable.
It is taught that only The Bible is true.  There are passages in The Bible which
can be (mis)interpreted to corroborate this.
It's tradition, and traditions are hard to break.

\subsection{Ezra Taft Benson on the \textit{Book of Mormon}}

\textit{From a Mission Training}

Ezra Taft Benson, ``The Book of Mormon and the Doctrine and Covenants'',
\textit{Ensign}, Jan. 2005, p. 10; also Apr. 1987 Conference

\begin{quote}
``It is important that in our teaching we make use of the language of holy writ.
Alma said, ``I … do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me''
(Alma 5:61).
	``The words and the way they are used in the Book of Mormon by the Lord
should become our source of understanding and should be used by us in teaching
gospel principles.''
\end{quote}

Ezra Taft Benson, ``Flooding the Earth with The Book of Mormon'',
\textit{Ensign}, Oct. 2005, p. 61; also Oct. 1988 Conference

\begin{quote}
``Missionaries need to know how to use the Book of Mormon to arouse mankind's
interest in studying it, and they need to show how it answers the great
questions of the soul. Missionaries need to read with those they teach various
passages from the Book of Mormon on gospel subjects.''
\end{quote}

Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{The Millenial Messiah}, p. 159, 170, 179

\textit{Not included in my original training, but also a good quote}

\begin{quote}
``Few men on earth either in or out of the Church, have caught the vision
of what the Book of Mormon is all about. Few are they among men who know the
part it has played and will yet play in preparing the way for the coming of Him
of whom it is a new witness. … The Book of Mormon shall so affect men that the
whole earth and all its peoples will have been influenced and governed by it. …
There is no greater issue ever to confront mankind in modern times than this: Is
the Book of Mormon the mind and will and voice of God to all men?''
\end{quote}

Ezra Taft Benson, ``The Book of Mormon---Keystone of Our Religion'',
\textit{Ensign}, Nov. 1986, p. 4

\begin{quote}
 ``In 1832, as some early missionaries returned from their fields of labor, the
Lord reproved them for treating the Book of Mormon lightly. As a result of that
attitude, he said, their minds had been darkened. Not only had treating this
sacred book lightly brought a loss of light to themselves, it had also brought
the whole Church under condemnation, even all the children of Zion. And then the
Lord said, ``And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and
remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon'' (D\&C 84:54-57) $\ldots$

	``If the early Saints were rebuked for treating the Book of Mormon
lightly, are we under any less condemnation if we do the same?''
\end{quote}

I then included teaching about how to better use The Book of Mormon in our
missionary work.

\subsection{Question: Why the Book of Mormon Given that We Have Latter-Day
Prophets?}

The Book of Mormon is the only book we push as missionaries.  It is the main
book of scripture that we read.

We have Latter-Day prophets.  The Doctrine and Covenants is great and has
doctrine above and beyond what the Book of Mormon has.  Prophets could add
anything.  Why rely on the Book of Mormon more?

Here are my thoughts.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item The people of the Book of Mormon actually existed.  The Book of Mormon
stands
as a witness that God speaks to all peoples.
\item The Book of Mormon has the doctrine that will bring us closer to Christ
than
anything else.  Anything more modern couldn't possibly be better.
\item  The Book of Mormon exists, so why not use it?  Why replace it?
\item  How could we have something like the Book of Mormon without all the
history
behind it?  It wouldn't be the same if it were a collection of abstract
revelations.  The stories and the doctrines we learn from the stories in the
Book of Mormon are in a sense "better" for our edification than dry instruction.
\item  We still have the other stuff to supplement our understanding of
doctrine.
\item The Book of Mormon is a record of a fallen people.  We can learn a lot
from
their fall.  (Pride was their fall.)  Our dispensation, however, will not fall.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Broken Heart and Contrite Spirit}

\textit{Note}:
I noticed that the phrase broken heart and contrite spirit is used a lot in the
Book of Mormon (a lot in my perception).  Why such an emphasis on that
particular phrasing?  What does it really mean?

\subsection{Places Where Used}

\subsubsection{Both Broken Heart and Contrite Spirit}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Psalm 34:18
 \item 2 Nephi 2:7
\item  2 Nephi 4:32
\item Jacob 2:10
\item 3 Nephi 9:20

\item  D\&C 20:37
\item  D\&C 56:17-18
\item  D\&C 59:8
\item  D\&C 97:8
\item  D\&C 138:42 (Isa. 61:1)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{At Least Part}

\begin{itemize}
 \item  Isaiah 66:2
\item Helaman 8:15
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hebrew Roots}

I am looking at the Strong's number on the words of Psalm 34:18.

\

\noindent The LORD [H3068] [is] nigh [H7138] unto them that are of a
broken [H7665] (8737) heart [H3820]; and saveth [H3467] (8686)
such as be of a contrite [H1793] spirit [H7307].

\

\noindent broken [H7665]: \textit{shabar}

\indent means broken

\indent\indent\indent 10) as seat of courage

mostly translated as heart

\noindent contrite [H1793]: dakka'

translation count: contrite 2, destruction 1

as an adjective means contrite; as a noun means dust

Gesenius's Lexicon:

		(1) very much crushed, broken very small, hence as a subst. that
which is very small, poet. for dust

		(2) broken in spirit, cast down

\noindent spirit [H7307]: \textit{ruwach}

\indent translation count: Spirit or spirit 232, wind 92, breath 27, side 6,
mind 5, blast 4, vain 2, air 1, anger 1, cool 1, courage 1, misc 6

\subsection{English Roots}

What does the word contrite mean?

\noindent \textit{Dictionary.com}

1. caused by or showing sincere remorse.

2. filled with a sense of guilt and the desire for atonement; penitent:
a contrite sinner.

Origin:
1300-50; Middle English contrit ($<$ Anglo-French ) $<$ Latin contritus
worn down, crushed, past participle of conterere

\subsection{Modern Explanations}

\textit{Book of Mormon Institute Manual}, p. 297:
Elder D. Todd Christofferson equates broken heart with repentant heart and
contrite spirit with obedient spirit.

\subsection{Personal Impressions}
This is similar to the "strait and narrow path" as a phrase which is used often
and a phrase having two similar adjectives.

\section{Calling and Election Made Sure}

Many blessings we received are conditional to our faithfulness, like temple
ordinances.  There comes a time when the Lord decides that we have done our
part.  At this point our calling and election are made sure and the Lord grants
us these blessings.

After reading quotes about it, it appears that our calling and election being
made sure occurs through a personal visit from the Savior.  See D\&C 93:1.

Joseph Smith, \textit{Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith}, p. 150. [my
boldface]

\begin{quote}
 After a person has faith in Christ, repents of his sins, and is baptized for
the
remission of his sins and receives the Holy Ghost, (by the laying on of hands) …
then let him continue to humble himself before God, hungering and thirsting
after righteousness, and living by every word of God, and the Lord will soon say
unto him, Son, thou shalt be exalted. When the Lord has thoroughly proved him,
and finds that the man is determined to serve Him at all hazards, then the man
will find his calling and his election made sure, then it will be his privilege
to receive the other Comforter, which the Lord hath promised the Saints, as is
recorded in the testimony of St. John.
\end{quote}

Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{Doctrinal New Testament Commentary}, vol. 3, p.330
\begin{quote}

Now what is meant by making a calling sure?

	All blessings promised in connection with the callings of God are
conditional; they are offered to men provided they obey the laws upon which
their receipt is predicated. (D. \& C. 130:20-21.) "For all who will have a
blessing at my hands," the Lord says, "shall abide the law which was appointed
for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before
the foundation of the world." (D. \& C. 132:5.)

	It follows, then, that when the law has been lived to the full, the
promised blessing is guaranteed. "I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say;
but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise." (D. \& C. 82:10.)
Accordingly, when a man lives the law that qualifies him for eternal life, the
Lord is bound by his own law to confer that greatest of all gifts upon him. And
if by a long course of trial and obedience, while yet in this life, a man proves
to the Lord that he has and will abide in the truth, the Lord accepts the
exhibited devotion and issues his decree that the promised blessings shall be
received. The calling, which up to that time was provisional, is then made sure.
The receipt of the promised blessings are no longer conditional; they are
guaranteed. Announcement is made that every gospel blessing shall be inherited.
What is meant by making an election sure?

	It is with election as with calling: the chosen of the Lord are offered
all of the blessings of the gospel on condition of obedience to the Lord's laws;
and they, having been tried and tested and found worthy in all things,
eventually have a seal placed on their election which guarantees the receipt of
the promised blessing.

What is meant by having one's calling and election made sure?

	To have one's calling and election made sure is to be sealed up unto
eternal life; it is to have the unconditional guarantee of exaltation in the
highest heaven of the celestial world; it is to receive the assurance of
godhood; it is, in effect, to have the day of judgment advanced, so that an
inheritance of all the glory and honor of the Father's kingdom is assured prior
to the day when the faithful actually enter into the divine presence to sit with
Christ in his throne, even as he is "set down" with his "Father in his throne."
(Rev. 3:21.)
\end{quote}

Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{Doctrinal New Testament Commentary}, vol. 3, p.
348-349
\begin{quote}
 Who has had their calling and election made sure and how can they be
identified?

	In the providences of the Lord, there is no question that many of the
saints of all ages and dispensations have attained this high status, a fact
which can be known in individual cases by applying the principles above set
forth to the individual situation.

	In this present discussion we have named Isaiah, Ezekiel, John the
Revelator, Paul, William Clayton and "many others" of the Prophet's day, the
Ephesian Saints, and "all the saints who held communion with the general
assembly and Church of the Firstborn." (\textit{Teachings}, p. 151.)

	For our day, the Prophet Joseph Smith is the classical example of one
who was sealed up unto eternal life. Of him the revelation states: "I am the
Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world, and through
all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne
for you in the kingdom of my Father, with Abraham your father." (D. \& C.
132:49.)

	Obviously if it applies to Isaiah and Ezekiel, it applies also to
Jeremiah, Samuel, Moses, Joshua and all of the prophets; if it applies to Joseph
Smith and William Clayton and "many others" in the Prophet's day, certainly a
great many of the later worthies of this dispensation are also included; and if
a sizeable number of the Ephesian Saints were so classified, then surely the
same applies to like groups of the saints in Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Philippi,
Colosse, Thessalonica, and in all the places where the Meridian Saints were
congregated. If Paul and John are part of the group, so also are Peter, James,
Titus, Jude, Matthew, the other apostles, and many of the preachers of
righteousness of that ancient day.

	And can there be any question that the same was true among the Nephites?
And Jaredites? That it included all of the City of Zion and those who were
thereafter caught up to heaven to dwell with Enoch and his translated brethren?
And if this glorious principle has always operated in days past, is it beyond
reason that it is still sealing blessings upon the heads of the Latter-day
Saints? Verily, such is the case now-a situation which we anticipate shall be
increasingly so as the Millennium approaches, during which period the sealing
power and all its attendant blessings will abound on every side.

	As with all the blessings of the gospel, the glorious reality of having
one's calling and election made sure is within the power of the faithful saints
to obtain, including both men and women.

\section{Commitment}

\subsection{"Brother, I'm Committed"}

Two young brothers stood atop a small cliff that overlooked the pristine waters
of a blue lake. This was a popular diving spot, and the brothers had often
talked about making the jump---something they had seen others do.

Although they both wanted to make the jump, neither one wanted to be first. The
height of the cliff wasn't that great, but to the two young boys, it seemed the
distance increased whenever they started to lean forward---and their courage was
fading fast.

Finally, one brother put one foot at the edge of the cliff and moved decisively
forward. At that moment his brother whispered, ``Maybe we should wait until next
summer.''

The first brother's momentum, however, was already pulling him forward.
``Brother,'' he responded, ``I'm committed!''

He splashed into the water and surfaced quickly with a victorious shout. The
second brother followed instantly. Afterward, they both laughed about the first
boy's final words before plunging into the water: ``Brother, I'm committed.''

Commitment is a little like diving into the water. Either you are committed or
you are not. Either you are moving forward or you are standing still. There's no
halfway. We all face moments of decision that change the rest of our lives. As
members of the Church, we must ask ourselves, ``Will I dive in or just stand at
the edge? Will I step forward or merely test the temperature of the water with
my toes?''

\subsection{How Can I Be More Committed}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Maginfy callings
 \item Sabbath day
 \item Quality scripture study
 \item Quality prayer

\section{Controversies (Misc.)}

\subsection{Skin Color}
\label{sub:skincolor}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 3 Ne. 2:15
 \item 2 Ne. 5:21
 \item Alma 3:6-19: Explains ``marks'' God places upon people; the curse of the
Lamanites
was that they were cut off from God and His church (the Nephites had the
scriptures, for example).
 \item Gen. 24:3
 \item 2 Cor. 6:14-17
\end{itemize}




\textit{Book of Mormon Institute Manual}, Alma 3:6-15, p. 174

\begin{quote}
 There is a difference between the mark and the curse.  The mark placed upon the
Lamanites was a dark skin (see Alma 3:6).  The curse was not the dark skin but
being ``cut off from the presence of the Lord'' (2 Nephi 5:20).  Notice that in
both Alma 3:7 and Alma 3:14 the conjunction and is used between the curse and
the mark.  This implies that they are not the same thing.  The people brought
the curse upon themselves: ``And even so doth every man that is cursed bring
upon
himself his own condemnation'' (Alma 3:19).  Through righteousness the curse may
be removed, but the mark may remain as it has with the Lamanites.
\end{quote}


\textit{Book of Mormon Institute Manual}, ``2 Nephi 5:20-25. The Lamanites Were
Cursed'', p. 62.

\begin{quote}
It is also explained in verse 21 that so ``they might not be enticing unto my
people [the Nephites] the Lord did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them
[the Lamanites].'' It would appear that this was done to limit the spreading of
more wickedness. Later Alma suggested this same motive when he explained that
``the skins of the Lamanites were
dark  $\ldots$  that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they
might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions'' (Alma 3:6, 8).
Throughout scripture we find warnings of the Lord not to marry unbelievers (see
Deuteronomy 7:2-3; 2
Corinthians 6:14); the result of doing so was often that the righteous were
turned away from the Lord (see Deuteronomy 7:4; 1 Kings 11:4; D\&C 74:5).
\end{quote}

Joseph Fielding Smith, \textit{Answers to Gospel Questions}, 3:122-23

\begin{quote}
``The dark skin was placed upon the Lamanites so that they could be
distinguished
from the Nephites and to keep the two peoples from mixing. The dark skin was the
sign of the curse [not the curse itself]. The curse was the withdrawal of the
Spirit of the Lord $\ldots$
``The dark skin of those who have come into the Church is no longer to be
considered a sign of the curse $\ldots$ These converts are delightsome and have
the Spirit of the Lord.''

 \item Abraham: the darkness was because there was nothing on the earth yet
 \item Abraham: they ``comprehended'' the light
 \item Moses: God called light day and darkness night ``by the power of His
word''; Abraham is more specific in what is day and what is night
 \item Abraham: ``expanse'' in the midst of the waters; Moses: ``it was so,

 ``I remember when I was a college student there were great
discussions on the question of organic evolution. I took classes in geology and
biology and heard the whole story of Darwinism as it was then taught. I wondered
about it. I thought much about it. But I did not let it throw me, for I read
what the scriptures said about our origins and our relationship to God. Since
then I have become acquainted with what to me is a far more important and
wonderful kind of evolution. It is the evolution of men and women as the sons
and daughters of God, and of our marvelous potential for growth as children of
our Creator.''

\end{itemize}


\section{Debt}

\begin{quote}
``Debt'', Gospel Topics (on LDS.org)

Since the early days of the Church, the Lord's prophets have repeatedly warned
against the bondage of debt. One of the great dangers of debt is the interest
that accompanies it. When it is necessary to incur debt, such as a reasonable
amount to purchase a modest home or to complete one's education, the debt
should be repaid as quickly as possible.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}

``Debt'', {\it True to the Faith}, p. 48-49 (my italics added)

 If you do incur debt, such as a reasonable amount in order to purchase a
modest home or complete your education, {\it work to repay it as quickly as
possible and free yourself from bondage}. When you have paid your debts and
accumulated some savings, you will be prepared for financial storms that may
come your way. You will have shelter for your family and peace in your heart
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
N. Eldon Tanner, ``Constancy and Change,'' {\it Ensign},
June 1982, 4

 ``I am convinced that it is not the amount of money an individual earns that
brings peace of mind as much as it is having control of his money. Money can be
an obedient servant, but a harsh taskmaster''
\end{quote}


\begin{quote}
Janene Wolsey Baadsgaard, ``Avoiding the Debt Trap,'' {\it Ensign}, Aug. 1996
(My italics added)

 With the wisdom of long experience, many older couples---both those who have
wisely avoided the debt trap and those who have learned from their
mistakes---often counsel young couples not to let money matter more than other
things in life. They don't regret money they didn't earn, degrees they didn't
get, or {\it honors they didn't obtain}. They do regret time they didn't spend
with each other, their children, their parents, and their friends. They realize
that commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ and to truly loving family
relationships yields life's greatest satisfaction.
\end{quote}


\subsection{Scripture References}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Luke 16:10-11
 \item D\&C 19:35
 \item 2 Kgs. 4:7
 \item Prov. 22:7
 \item Rom. 13:8
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textit{True to the Faith}, ``Debt''

This book takes the stance that we ought to avoid debt because without it we
have much more security.

\begin{quote}
 ``If you do incur debt, such as a reasonable amount in order to
purchase a modest home or complete your education, work to repay it as quickly
as possible and free yourself from bondage.''
\end{quote}

Common sense says this is a risk-averse stance.  It makes sense from the
standpoint that we aren't maximizing our expected wealth we are maximizing our
probability of having enough.  Another point is that, as mentioned in the Black
Swan, the markets are thick-tailed.  A market crash can happen more than we
realize.  Wise advise in 2008 would have been to get out of debt before the
market crashed.  As members of the church, we ought not to discount prophetic
insight.

\subsection{Wants vs. Needs}

Joseph B. Wirthlin, "Earthly Debts, Heavenly Debts," \textit{Ensign}, May 2004,
42

\begin{quote}
``All too often a family's spending is governed more by their yearning than by
their earning. They somehow believe that their life will be better if they
surround themselves with an abundance of things. All too often all they are left

they really do not need.''

\section{Diligence}


Note, Church, 2010.10.17: The Sunday School teacher told a personal story.  She
ran a marathon and had a positive experience.  She planned on running a half
marathon six months from her marathon.  She eased up on her training since she
was confident about running a full marathon.  As a result, the half marathon was
very hard.

How am I like that?

I served a mission, but now that I am in real life there is a temptation to be
lax on some of the principles I practiced.

\subsection{Work}

Note, 2011.06.14:
It is easy for me to get lazy and focus on entertaining myself.  However, I
always feel better when I put in an honest day's work.


\section{Discipleship}

Note, Church, 2010.10.18:

\section{Faith}

\subsection{What Is Faith?}

\subsubsection{As Defined in Scripture}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Alma 32:21
Ether 12:6
Hebrews 11:1 (See JST)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{As Defined in the Dictionary}

\textit{Wikipedia}, ``Faith'', accessed 2010.11.17

\begin{quote}
Faith is the confident belief or trust in the truth or trustworthiness of a
person, idea, or thing that is not based on proof.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Greek Roots}

\textit{Wikipedia}, ``Faith in Christianity'', accessed 2010.11.17

\begin{quote}
The word "faith" $\ldots$ was primarily used
in the New Testament with the Greek perfect tense and translates as a noun-verb
hybrid; which is not adequately conveyed by the English noun. Pi'stis in the New
Testament context is a physical action, based upon a mental belief and sustained
with confidence. Belief, in this context is non-synonymous with faith because,
belief primarily conveys the mental action, thought of confidence, trust, and/or
firm persuasion, not the physical act. Depending on the context, the Greek word
may also be understood to mean "faithfulness" or "fidelity" (cf. 1 Thess 3:7;
Titus 2:10); indeed, Karl Barth consistently translates "pistis" as "the
faithfulness of God" in his commentary Epistle to the Romans.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Breaking Down the Concept of Faith}

\textit{True to the Faith}, "Faith" (with numbering added by me)

\begin{quote}
In order for your faith to lead you to salvation, it must be centered in the
Lord Jesus Christ (see Acts 4:10-12; Mosiah 3:17; Moroni 7:24-26; Articles of
Faith 1:4). You can exercise faith in Christ when you have an (1) assurance that
He exists, a (2) correct idea of His character, and a (3) knowledge that you are
striving to live according to His will.
\end{quote}

James 2:17-19

\begin{quote}
If we but believe in Christ, yet not keep His commandments--for we know that
through obedience to His commandments we receive both temporary blessings in
this life as well as, ultimately, the great eternal blessing of everlasting life
in His presence--then truly we do not have faith.
\end{quote}

Moroni 7:33

\begin{quote}
"And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do
whatsoever thing is expedient in me."
\end{quote}

\textit{Preach My Gospel},, p. 61

\begin{quote}
"Having faith in Christ includes$\ldots$"
Having "a firm belief that He is the Only Begotten Son of God and the Savior and
Redeemer of the World".
Recognizing "that we can return to live with our Heavenly Father only by relying
on His Son's grace and mercy."
Accepting and applying "His Atonement and His teachings."
Trusting "Him and what He says."
Knowing "that He has power to keep His promises."
\end{quote}

\textit{Thought from my missionary study journal}

\begin{quote}
Sometimes we receive blessings just by keeping a commandment; we are not
withheld the blessing because we don't exercise a great mental effort to believe
in Him; for example, we will have better health if we keep the Word of Wisdom.
	Great faith is important, however, for realizing great blessings and for
working miracles (the kind of miracles I would have liked to have "performed" on
my mission.)
\end{quote}

Joseph Smith, \textit{Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith},

Pres. Thomas S. Monson, ``Great Expectations'', CES Fireside Jan 11, 2009

\begin{quote}
``Remember that doubt and faith cannot exist in the mind at the same time, for
one will dispel the other. Whereas doubt destroys, faith fulfills. An attitude
of faith brings one closer to God and to His purposes.''
\end{quote}

Stephen L. Richards, in \textit{Conference Report}, Oct. 1937, 39.

\begin{quote}
``Just say to those skeptical, disturbing, rebellious thoughts, ‘I propose to
stay with my faith, with the faith of my people. I know that happiness and
contentment are there and I forbid you, agnostic, doubting thoughts, to destroy
the house of my faith. I acknowledge that I do not understand the processes of
creation, but I accept the fact of it. I grant that I cannot explain the
miracles of the Bible, and I do not attempt to do so, but I accept God's word. I
wasn't with Joseph, but I believe him. My faith did not come to me through
science and I will not permit science to destroy it.'''
\end{quote}

\subsection{Asking for Things}

3 Nephi 18:20

\begin{quote}
Ask the Father in the name of Christ

Which is right

Believing that ye shall receive
\end{quote}

Mormon 9:21
\begin{quote}
Believe in Christ, doubting nothing

Ask the Father in the name of Christ
\end{quote}

Moroni 7:26

\begin{quote}
Ask the Father in the name of Christ

Which is good

In faith, believing that ye shall receive
\end{quote}

D\&C 88:64
\begin{quote}
Ask the Father in the name of Christ

That [it] is expedient for you
\end{quote}

\subsection{Faith and Fear}

Can't have both faith and fear simultaneously.

{\it Example:} Peter walks on water, but then begins to fear.

\subsection{Faith and Confidence}

I read a blog post (Gordon Bean) about faith and confidence.  Here are some of the
points I learned from it:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidence is a consequence of faith.  We do not choose to
		have confidence, but is a consequence of our knowledge.  For
		example, if I have a phone in my hand, I cannot make myself be
		confident that when I release my hand it will not fall to the
		ground.
	\item Faith is about accepting light and truth when we encounter
		it and following it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A Missionary Training}

John 14:15

Faith forces us to develop love, and love and faith motivate us to obey the
commandments regardless of the consequences.
How does our faith in Christ increase the number of baptisms we have?

\textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 156
\begin{quote}
"Have faith that you will know what to teach and what to do to find those who
will receive you." (I talked about what we know and how we should act as a
result)
\end{quote}

\textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 146: "Goal setting and planning are acts of
faith." (I talked about why that is).
How does faith relate to teaching?

D\&C 42:12-14, D\&C 50:13-14

(I talked about other things about invitations, citing \textit{Preach My
Gospel}, p. 196.)

\subsection{Personal Experiences}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Accepting the call to be a temple worker
 \item Following the spirit on my mission (E. Alves, Em\'{\i}lio)
 \item Following the spirit and coming to S.D.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Fall}

``Agency and the Fall of Adam and Eve'', \textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 49

\begin{quote}
``While Adam and Eve were in the garden, they were still in God's presence and
could have lived forever. They lived in innocence, and God provided for their
needs$\ldots$

	``$\ldots$they were cast out from the garden and out of God's physical
presence. This event is called the Fall. Separation from God's presence is
spiritual death. Adam and Eve became mortal---subject to physical death or
separation of the body and spirit$\ldots$''

	``They had moral agency or the ability to choose between good and evil.
This made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible
for them to make wrong choices and sin. In addition, they could now have
children, so the rest of God's spirit children could come to earth, obtain
physical bodies, and be tested. Only in this way could God's children progress
and become like Him.''
\end{quote}

\subsection{Was Adam's Transgression Really a Sin?}

Brigham Young, as quoted in \textit{Doctrines of Salvation} 1:104

\begin{quote}
``How did Adam and Eve sin? Did they come out in direct opposition to God and to
his government? No. But they transgressed a command of the Lord, and through
that transgression sin came into the world''
\end{quote}

Joseph Fielding Smith, ``The Fall of Adam Was Not a Sin'', \textit{Answers to
Gospel Questions}, 2:214

\begin{quote}
``The transgression of the law, contrary to the view of many, was not a sin. It
was not a sin any more than the transgression in the laboratory by a chemist in
combining two substances and creating another entirely different from the first.
It was not a sin to bring to pass mortality, a condition which was essential to
the eternal welfare of man.''
\end{quote}

\subsection{Difference between transgression and sin}

 \item D\&C 132:34-37: If the Lord commands something, it is OK in that
circumstance.
 \item Jacob 2:27: The Nephites could only have one wife
\end{itemize}

\subsection{My personal opinion}

\textit{from when I was single}

I feel in my heart that I am doing OK in dating. I may not date up to my
own---unrealistic?---expectations, but I am doing what I can. Procuring dates is
a
weakness for me, so I believe that I cannot be expected to do as well as others
at it.

	Some say that if a man doesn't make temple marriage happen, then he
automatically falls short of exaltation. My feeling is, if I live a righteous
life I will have that opportunity, whether I achieve it in this life or not. I
will not be guaranteed that opportunity, however, if I decide to marry outside
of the covenant instead of holding out for more. In my opinion that is the
separator.

\subsection{Influence of Parents on their Young Children}

Pres. Thomas S. Monson, ``Great Expectations'', CES Fireside 2009.01.04

\begin{quote}
``The Lord tells us in the Doctrine and Covenants that during the first eight
years of our lives, power is not given unto Satan to tempt us as little children
(see D\&C 29:46-47). We had an eight-year head start on Lucifer.

This information was given by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith back
in 1830. In our own time Dr. Glenn Doman, a renowned scholar and scientist who
has almost definitely never heard of the revelation quoted, has, through his
research, come to the conclusion that ``a newborn child is almost an exact
duplicate of [a] computer, although superior to one in almost every way.
``What is placed in the child's brain during the first eight years of life is
probably there to stay. If you put misinformation into his brain during this
period, it is extremely difficult to erase it.'' He believed that the most
receptive age in human life is that of two or three years old.
\end{quote}

\noindent Notes, Church 2010.09.05

\begin{quote}
I was struck by the experience of one of the brothers in the priesthood meeting.
 He told about how his parents, although good people, were lazy.  They didn't do
things such as FHE, attend the temple, home teaching, family scripture study,
etc.  A probable result was that out of their large family this brother was the
only one of his siblings who was still an active member of the church.

\subsection{Wayward Children}
``Hope for Parents of Wayward Children,'' \textit{Ensign}, Sep 2002, 11

\begin{quote}
Joseph Smith (1805-44) First President of the Church

``The Prophet Joseph Smith declared---and he never taught a more comforting
doctrine---that the eternal sealings of faithful parents and the divine promises
made to them for valiant service in the Cause of Truth, would save not only
themselves, but likewise their posterity. Though some of the sheep may wander,
the eye of the Shepherd is upon them, and sooner or later they will feel the
tentacles of Divine Providence reaching out after them and drawing them back to
the fold. Either in this life or the life to come, they will return. They will
have to pay their debt to justice; they will suffer for their sins; and may
tread a thorny path; but if it leads them at last, like the penitent Prodigal,
to a loving and forgiving father's heart and home, the painful experience will
not have been in vain. Pray for your careless and disobedient children; hold on
to them with your faith. Hope on, trust on, till you see the salvation of God''
(Orson F. Whitney, in Conference Report, Apr. 1929, 110).

Brigham Young (1801-77) Second President of the Church

``Let the father and mother, who are members of this Church and Kingdom, take a
righteous course, and strive with all their might never to do a wrong, but to do
good all their lives; if they have one child or one hundred children, if they
conduct themselves towards them as they should, binding them to the Lord by
their faith and prayers, I care not where those children go, they are bound up
to their parents by an everlasting tie, and no power of earth or hell can
separate them from their parents in eternity; they will return again to the
fountain from whence they sprang'' (quoted in Joseph Fielding Smith, Doctrines
of
Salvation, comp. Bruce R. McConkie, 3 vols. [1954-56], 2:90-91).

Lorenzo Snow (1814-1901) Fifth President of the Church

``If you succeed in passing through these trials and afflictions and receive a
resurrection, you will, by the power of the Priesthood, work and labor, as the
Son of God has, until you get all your sons and daughters in the path of
exaltation and glory. This is just as sure as that the sun rose this morning
over yonder mountains. Therefore, mourn not because all your sons and daughters
do not follow in the path that you have marked out to them, or give heed to your
counsels. Inasmuch as we succeed in securing eternal glory, and stand as
saviors, and as kings and priests to our God, we will save our posterity'' (in
Collected Discourses, comp. Brian H. Stuy, 5 vols. [1987-92], 3:364).

Boyd K. Packer, Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles

``The measure of our success as parents … will not rest solely on how our
children turn out. That judgment would be just only if we could raise our
families in a perfectly moral environment, and that now is not possible.

``It is not uncommon for responsible parents to lose one of their children, for
a
time, to influences over which they have no control. They agonize over
rebellious sons or daughters. They are puzzled over why they are so helpless
when they have tried so hard to do what they should.

``It is my conviction that those wicked influences one day will be overruled.
$\ldots$

``We cannot overemphasize the value of temple marriage, the binding ties of the
sealing ordinance, and the standards of worthiness required of them. When
parents keep the covenants they have made at the altar of the temple, their
children will be forever bound to them'' (``Our Moral Environment,''
\textit{Ensign}, May 1992, 68).
\end{quote}

Spencer W. Kimball, \textit{Ensign}, Nov. 1974, pp. 111-12.

\begin{quote}
``There is no guarantee, of course, that righteous parents will succeed always
in
holding their children, and certainly they may lose them if they do not do all
in their power. The children have their free agency.

``But if we as parents fail to influence our families and set them on the
‘strait
and narrow way,' then certainly the waves, the winds of temptation and evil will
carry the posterity away from the path.

`` ‘Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not
depart from it.' (Prov. 22:6.) What we do know is that righteous parents who
strive to develop wholesome in influences for their children will be held
blameless at the last day, and that they will succeed in saving most of their
children, if not all.''
\end{quote}

James E. Faust, ``Dear Are the Sheep That Have Wandered,'' \textit{Liahona}, May
2003,
61-62, 67-68

\begin{quote}
A principle in this statement [the quote from Joseph Smith] that is often
overlooked is that they must fully repent and ``suffer for their sins'' and
``pay
their debt to justice.'' I recognize that now is the time ``to prepare to meet
God.'' If the repentance of the wayward children does not happen in this life,
is
it still possible for the cords of the sealing to be strong enough for them yet
to work out their repentance? In the Doctrine and Covenants we are told, ``The
dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of the
house of God,

``And after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed
clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are heirs of
salvation.''

We remember that the prodigal son wasted his inheritance, and when it was all
gone he came back to his father's house. There he was welcomed back into the
family, but his inheritance was spent. Mercy will not rob justice, and the
sealing power of faithful parents will only claim wayward children upon the
condition of their repentance and Christ's Atonement. Repentant wayward children
will enjoy salvation and all the blessings that go with it, but exaltation is
much more. It must be fully earned. The question as to who will be exalted must
be left to the Lord in His mercy.

There are very few whose rebellion and evil deeds are so great that they have
``sinned away the power to repent.'' That judgment must also be left up to the
Lord. He tells us, ``I, the Lord, will forgive whom I will forgive, but of you
it
is required to forgive all men.''

Perhaps in this life we are not given to fully understand how enduring the
sealing cords of righteous parents are to their children. It may very well be
that there are more helpful sources at work than we know. I believe there is a
strong familial pull as the influence of beloved ancestors continues with us
from the other side of the veil.

President Howard W. Hunter observed that ``repentance is but the homesickness of
the soul, and the uninterrupted and watchful care of the parent is the fairest
earthly type of the unfailing forgiveness of God.'' Is not the family the
nearest
analogy which the Savior's mission sought to establish?

\section{Feasts and Festivals}

Holiday = "holy day"

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent\textit{Old Testament Institute Manual}, (D-3)

\begin{quote}
Although the ancient Israelites had many days in the year set apart for
festivities or fasting and prayer, four besides the sabbaths were of particular
importance: the feast of Passover, the feast of Pentecost, the day of Atonement,
and the feast of Tabernacles.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Sabbath}

See $\S$ \ref{sec:sabbath}.



\subsection{The Feast of Passover ( Pesach )}

\begin{quote}
The feast of Passover, together with the feast of Unleavened Bread, commemorated
the Israelites' deliverance from Egyptian slavery. The festival began on the
fifteenth day of Nisan (the latter part of March) and continued for seven days.
The main part of the celebration was the eating of the paschal, or Passover,
meal of bitter herbs, unleavened bread, and roasted lamb. The lamb was slain the
evening before the celebration began, and the father of each household sprinkled
its blood on the door posts and lintel of the home. Strict rules governed the
preparation and eating of the paschal meal. The lamb was to be roasted whole,
care being taken not to break any of its bones. The members of the family stood
and ate hastily. Any portions of the lamb remaining from the meal were to be
burned.

The ritual reminded Israel of the days of bondage in Egypt when life, like the
herbs, was indeed bitter, and helped them remember their deliverance by the Lord
when unleavened bread was eaten for seven days and the people awaited the signal
to begin their journey to freedom.

But the chief significance of the ritual was not historical. The details of the
performances involved were arranged to bear witness not merely of Israel's
deliverance but also of her Deliverer.

``1. ‘Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year,' signifying
that the Lamb of God, pure and perfect, without spot or blemish, in the prime of
his life, as the Paschal Lamb, would be slain for the sins of the world.

``2. They were to take of the blood of the lamb and sprinkle it upon the
doorposts of their houses, having this promise as a result: ‘And the blood shall
be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I
will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you,'
signifying that the blood of Christ, which should fall as drops in Gethsemane
and flow in a stream from a pierced side as he hung on the cross, would cleanse
and save the faithful; and that, as those in Israel were saved temporally
because the blood of a sacrificial lamb was sprinkled on the doorposts of their
houses, so the faithful of all ages would wash their garments in the blood of
the Eternal Lamb and from him receive an eternal salvation. And may we say that
as the angel of death passed by the families of Israel because of their
faith---as
Paul said of Moses, ‘through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of
blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them' ( Heb. 11:28
)---even so shall the Angel of Life give eternal life to all those who rely on
the
blood of the Lamb.

``3. As to the sacrifice of the lamb, the decree was, ‘Neither shall ye break a
bone thereof,' signifying that when the Lamb of God was sacrificed on the cross,
though they broke the legs of the two thieves to induce death, yet they brake
not the bones of the Crucified One ‘that the scripture should be fulfilled, A
bone of him shall not be broken.' ( John 19:31-36 .)

``4. As to the eating the flesh of the sacrificial lamb, the divine word was,
‘No
uncircumcised person shall eat thereof,' signifying that the blessings of the
gospel are reserved for those who come into the fold of Israel, who join the
Church, who carry their part of the burden in bearing off the kingdom;
signifying also that those who eat his flesh and drink his blood, as he said,
shall have eternal life and he will raise them up at the last day. ( John 6:54
.)

``5. As ‘the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt' because they
believed not the word of the Lord delivered to them by Moses and Aaron, even so
should the Firstborn of the Father, who brings life to all who believe in his
holy name, destroy worldly people at the last day, destroy all those who are in
the Egypt of darkness, whose hearts are hardened as were those of Pharaoh and
his minions.

``6. On the first and seventh days of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the
Israelites were commanded to hold holy convocations in which no work might be
done except the preparation of their food. These were occasions for preaching
and explaining and exhorting and testifying. We go to sacrament meetings to be
built up in faith and in testimony. Ancient Israel attended holy convocations
for the same purposes. Knowing that all things operate by faith, would it be
amiss to draw the conclusion that it is as easy for us to look to Christ and his
spilt blood for eternal salvation as it was for them of old to look to the blood
of the sacrificed lamb, sprinkled on doorposts, to give temporal salvation, when
the angel of death swept through the land of Egypt?

\subsection{The Feast of Weeks ( Shavuot, or Pentecost)}

Pentecost = the fiftieth day; it came seven weeks after Passover.

\begin{quote}
Marked the beginning of the harvest of the new wheat: "The offerings placed upon
the great altar on that day included sheaves of wheat and signified to all
present that while man plows the ground, sows the seed, and reaps the harvest,
God is the real giver of the increase$\ldots$One purpose of the festival was so
that all Israel would truly say, 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulness
thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein' ( Psalm 24:1 )."

On this day two lambs, a young bull, and two rams were offered as sin and peace
offerings, and burned on the altar of sacrifice. These sacrifices indicated that
the purpose of the feast was for Israel to gain a remission of sins and obtain a
reconciliation with God.

``With the closing of the Old and the opening of the New Dispensation, the Feast
of Pentecost ceased as an authorized time of religious worship. And it is not
without significance that the Lord chose the Pentecost, which grew out of the
final Passover, as the occasion to dramatize forever the fulfillment of all that
was involved in the sacrificial fires of the past. Fire is a cleansing agent.
Filth and disease die in its flames. The baptism of fire, which John promised
Christ would bring, means that when men receive the actual companionship of the
Holy Spirit, then evil and iniquity are burned out of their souls as though by
fire. The sanctifying power of that member of the Godhead makes them clean. In
similar imagery, all the fires on all the altars of the past, as they burned the
flesh of animals, were signifying that spiritual purification would come by the
Holy Ghost, whom the Father would send because of the Son. On that first
Pentecost of the so-called Christian Era such fires would have performed their
purifying symbolism if the old order had still prevailed. How fitting it was
instead for the Lord to choose that very day to send living fire from heaven, as
it were, fire that would dwell in the hearts of men and replace forever all the
fires on all the altars of the past. And so it was that ‘when the day of
Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And
suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it
filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them
cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all
filled with the Holy Ghost.' ( Acts 2:1-4 .)'' ( The Promised Messiah, pp.
431-32.)
\end{quote}

My own thought: the symbolism of these feasts and festivals by design prophecies
of events like the Pentecost in Acts 2.

\subsection{The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)}

\begin{quote}
Of all the religious days in the Hebrew calendar, the day of Atonement was the
most solemn and sacred. All manual labor stopped, and there was no feasting or
frolicking. It was, instead, a time to ``afflict'' one's soul by fasting, a day
to
cleanse oneself from sin, a day for prayer, meditation, and deep contrition of
soul ( Leviticus 16:29 ).

``On one day each year---the tenth day of the seventh month---Israel's high
priest of
the Levitical order, the one who sat in Aaron's seat, was privileged to enter
the Holy of Holies in the house of the Lord, to enter as it were the presence of
Jehovah, and there make an atonement for the sins of the people. In the course
of much sacrificial symbolism, he cleansed himself, the sanctuary itself, the
priesthood bearers as a whole, and all of the people. Sacrificial animals were
slain and their blood sprinkled on the mercy seat and before the altar; incense
was burned, and all of the imagery and symbolism of the ransoming ordinances was
carried out. One thing, applicable to this day only, is of great moment. Two
goats were selected, lots were cast, and the name of Jehovah was placed upon one
goat; the other was called Azazel, the scapegoat. The Lord's goat was then
sacrificed as the Great Jehovah would be in due course, but upon the scapegoat
were placed all of the sins of the people, which burden the scapegoat then
carried away into the wilderness. The high priest, as the law required, ‘lay
both his hands upon the head of the live goat' and confessed ‘over him all the
iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their
sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.' The goat then bore upon him ‘all
their iniquities unto a land not inhabited,' even as the Promised Messiah should
bear the sins of many. ‘For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for
you, to cleanse you,' Moses said, ‘that ye may be clean from all your sins
before the Lord.' ( Lev. 16 .)

``Knowing, as we do, that sins are remitted in the waters of baptism; that
baptisms were the order of the day in Israel; and that provision must be made
for repentant persons to free themselves from sins committed after baptism---we
see in the annual performances of the Day of Atonement one of the Lord's
provisions for renewing the covenant made in the waters of baptism and receiving
anew the blessed purity that comes from full obedience to the law involved. In
our day we gain a similar state of purity by partaking worthily of the sacrament
of the Lord's supper.

``The symbolism and meaning of the ordinances and ceremonies performed on the
Day
of Atonement are set forth by Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews. He calls the
tabernacle-temple ‘a worldly sanctuary,' wherein sacrificial ordinances were
performed each year by Levitical priests to atone for the sins of men and
prepare them to enter the Holy of Holies. These ordinances were to remain ‘until
the time of reformation,' when Christ should come as a high priest of ‘a greater
and more perfect tabernacle,' to prepare himself and all men, by the shedding of
his own blood, to obtain ‘eternal redemption' in the heavenly tabernacle. The
old covenant was but ‘a shadow of good things to come,  $\ldots$  For it is not
possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins $\ldots$  .
But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on
t e right hand of God.' ( Heb. 9 and 10 .) How perfectly the Mosaic ordinances
testify of Him by whom salvation comes and in whose holy name all men are
commanded to worship the Eternal Father forevermore!'' (McConkie, The Promised
Messiah, pp. 435-37.)
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Feast of Tabernacles (Succoth)}

\begin{quote}
The feast of Tabernacles (also called the feast of Booths or the feast of
Ingathering) occurred five days after the day of Atonement on the fifteenth day
of Tishri, the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar, which corresponds to our
late September or early October. The feast of Tabernacles began and ended on a
Sabbath and so was eight days in length.

A distinctive part of this celebration was the erecting of temporary huts or
booths ( succoth, in Hebrew) made from the boughs of trees. The people stayed in
these huts for the duration of the feast. This requirement reminded the people
of the goodness of the Lord during their forty-year sojourn in the wilderness of
Sinai and the blessing that was theirs to live permanently, if they were
obedient, in the promised land.

``More sacrifices were offered during the Feast of the Passover than at any
other
time because a lamb was slain for and eaten by each family or group, but at the
Feast of Tabernacles more sacrifices of bullocks, rams, lambs, and goats were
offered by the priests for the nation as a whole than at all the other Israelite
feasts combined. The fact that it celebrated the completion of the full harvest
symbolizes the gospel reality that it is the mission of the house of Israel to
gather all nations to Jehovah, a process that is now going forward, but will not
be completed until that millennial day when ‘the Lord shall be king over all the
earth,' and shall reign personally thereon. Then shall be fulfilled that which
is written: ‘And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the
nations  $\ldots$  shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the
Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. And it shall be, that whoso
ill not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the
King, the Lord of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.' ( Zech. 14:9-21 .)
That wi l be the day when the law shall go forth from Zion and the word of the
Lor from Jerusalem. Manifestly when the Feast of Tabernacles is kept in that
day, ts ritualistic performances will conform to the new gospel order and not
include the Mosaic order of the past.

``Included in the Feast of Tabernacles was a holy convocation, which in this
instance was called also a solemn assembly. In our modern solemn assemblies we
give the Hosanna Shout, which also was associated with the Feast of Tabernacles
anciently, except that ancient Israel waved palm branches instead of white
handkerchiefs as they exulted in such declarations as ‘Hosanna, Hosanna,
Hosanna, to God and the Lamb.' By the time of Jesus some added rituals were part
of the feast, including the fact that a priest went to the Pool of Siloam, drew
water in a golden pitcher, brought it to the temple, and poured it into a basin
at the base of the altar. As this was done the choir sang the Hallel, consisting
of Psalms 113 to 118 . ‘When the choir came to these words, ``O give thanks to
the Lord,'' and again when they sang, ``O work then now salvation, Jehovah;''
and
once more at the close, ``O give thanks unto the Lord,'' all the worshippers
shook
their lulavs [palm branches] towards the altar,' which is closely akin to what
we do in giving the Hosanna Shout today. ‘When, therefore, the multitudes from
Jerusalem, on meeting Jesus, ``cut down branches from the trees, and strewed
them
in the way, and  $\ldots$  cried, saying, O then, work now salvation to the Son
of David!'' they applied, in reference to Christ, what was regarded as one of
the
chief ceremonies of the Feast of Tabernacles, praying that God would now from
``the highest'' heavens manifest and send that salvation in connection with the
Son of David, which was symbolised by the pouring out of water.' (Alfred
Edersheim, The Temple, p. 279.)'' (McConkie, The Promised Messiah, pp. 433-34.)

\subsubsection{The idea of only a small number of people being the chosen
ones}
This is how it has been throughout history (then, today, Christ's time, etc.)
From a logical standpoint, there are only so many people per religion, and only
one religion can be right.

\subsection{History of Gathering and Scattering of Israel}
Captivity in Egypt---Moses---Settled in Promised Land

Wickedness $\rightarrow$ Split

Map 3: See division of tribes

North (Ephraim) captured by Assyrians

then 100 years later South (Judah) captured by Babylonians
	(Book of Mormon starts right before destruction of Jerusalem)
	((Note also that Book of Mormon highlights another part of the gathering
which is that the Lord scattered people to the isles of the sea))
		Ezek. 37:16-17: Stick of Ephraim, Stick of Judah

Babylon lets Jews go back after a while, and they rebuild Jerusalem

time of Christ

Jerusalem destroyed again and Jews scattered

\subsection{Why?}
This is what Jacob 5 is about.
Most of the world is of Israel by lineage (mathematics imply this).
Therefore we are part of the Abrahamic covenant.

\subsection{Gathering Today}
Through missionary work (see Book of Mormon title page); keys restored by Moses
to Joseph Smith in Kirtland Temple.

Joining church = part of house of Israel.

Not physical at this time.

In millenium will be physical (two world captials).

\subsection{Why Ephraim?}
Ephraim had the birthright.  This is simbolic of the rest of the tribes
receiving their birthright from the tribe of Ephraim.
The oxen in the temple simbolize Joseph bringing the tribes the gospel.
Also recall that Joseph saved his brothers from the famine.

Pray to Him (see James 1:5)

Obey all His commandments as best we can (see John 14:21-23).

\begin{quote}
	I testify that the way to know the truth about God is through the Holy
Ghost. The Holy Ghost, the third member of the Godhead, is a personage of
spirit. His work is to ``testify of [God]'' and to ``teach [us] all
things$\ldots$''

Gaining this knowledge is ultimately the quest of all God's children on
the earth. If you cannot remember believing in God or if you have ceased to
believe or if you believe but without real conviction, I invite you to seek a
testimony of God now. Do not be afraid of ridicule. The strength and peace that
come from knowing God and having the comforting companionship of His Spirit will
make your efforts eternally worthwhile.

\subsection{Following the Spirit}

\subsubsection{President Monson's example}

\textit{Ensign}, February 1986, p. 10.; "Thomas S. Monson$\ldots$" by Jeffrey R.
Holland
\begin{quote}
Twenty-three-year-old Tom Monson, relatively new bishop of the
Sixth-Seventh Ward in the Temple View Stake, was
uncharacteristically restless as the stake priesthood leadership
meeting progressed. He had the distinct impression that he should
leave the meeting immediately and drive to the Veterans' Hospital
high up on the Avenues of Salt Lake City. Before leaving home that
night he had received a telephone call informing him that an older
member of his ward was ill and had been admitted to the hospital for
care. Could the bishop, the caller wondered, find a moment to go by
the hospital sometime and give a blessing? The busy young leader
explained that he was just on his way to a stake meeting but that he
certainly would be pleased to go by the hospital as soon as the
meeting was concluded.

	Now the prompting was stronger than ever: ``Leave the meeting and
	proceed to the hospital at once.'' But the stake president himself
	was speaking at the pulpit! It would be most discourteous to stand
	in the middle of the presiding officer's message, make one's way
	over an entire row of brethren, and then exit the building
	altogether. Painfully he waited out the final moments of the stake
	president's message, then bolted for the door even before the
	benediction had been pronounced.

	Running the full length of the corridor on the fourth floor of the
	hospital, the young bishop saw a flurry of activity outside the
	designated room.  A nurse stopped him and said, ``Are you Bishop
	Monson?''

	``Yes,'' was the anxious reply.

	``I'm sorry,'' she said. ``The patient was calling your name just
	before he passed away.''

	Fighting back the tears, Thomas S. Monson turned and walked back
	into the night. He vowed then and there that he would never again
	fail to act upon a prompting from the Lord. He would acknowledge
	the impressions of the Spirit when they came, and he would follow
	wherever they led him, ever to be ``on the Lord's errand.''

Downfall," \textit{Ensign}, Oct. 1994, 13-14 (As quoted in PMG. p.
101) \begin{quote} [A person may have] a strong desire to be led by
	the Spirit of the Lord but$\ldots$unwisely extends that desire to
	the point of wanting to be led in all things. A desire to be led
	by the Lord is a strength, but it needs to be accompanied by an
	understanding that our Heavenly Father leaves many decisions for
	our personal choices. Personal decision making is one of the
	sources of the growth we are meant to experience in mortality.
	Persons who try to shift all decision making to the Lord and plead
	for revelation in every choice will soon find circumstances in
	which they pray for guidance and don't receive it. For example,
	this is likely to occur in those numerous circumstances in which
	the choices are trivial or either choice is acceptable.

We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers
our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance
and act upon it if we receive it. If we do not receive guidance, we
should act upon our best judgment. Persons who persist in seeking
revelatory guidance on subjects on which the Lord has not chosen to
direct us may concoct an answer out of their own fantasy or bias, or
they may even receive an answer through the medium of false
revelation.  \end{quote}

\noindent Note, Stake Conference, 2009.01.24: We will not be able to
do anything seriously wrong without being warned first.

\subsection{The Personage of the Holy Ghost}

\begin{itemize} \item D\&C 130:22: The Holy Ghost is a personage of
		Spirit.  \item {\it Gospel Principles}, ch. 7: The Holy Ghost
			can only be in one place at a time, but his influence can be
			felt in many places simultaneously.  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Destiny of the Personage of the Holy Ghost}

Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{Mormon Doctrine}, ``Holy Ghost'', p. 359
\begin{quote} In this dispensation at least, nothing has been
	revealed as to his origin or destiny; expressions on these matters
	are both speculative and fruitless.  \end{quote}

\subsection{Holy Ghost and the Plan of Salvation}

{\it Thought, 2013.04.14:} In the {\it Gospel Principles} manual,
Holy Ghost is Chapter 7.  The previous 6 chapters are heavy chapters
about God, our pre-mortal existence, agency, and the Fall of Adam
and Eve.  I think that Holy Ghost comes in at this point because of
how essential it is to the Plan of Salvation.  We are cut off from
God's presence; how are we to know what is right and wrong?  How are
we to know the truth?  The Holy Ghost provides just enough to show
us the truth.

\subsection{Personal Experiences}

\begin{itemize} \item Mission: Going a different way than was
		suggested by my companion \item Coming to S.D.  \item Going to
		Ralphs and then giving man \$20 \item Finding friends to invite
			me to the movies (I don't understand what the benefit was
		other than I filled an otherwise boring night).  \item Learning
			Spanish (I appreciate that I can work in the temple in
			Spanish, but I can't really say what exactly are the
			overarching benefits of this decision)\footnote{2013.04.15: I
			don't know when I wrote this, but to me now it is a matter of
		fact that the benefit of learning Spanish was meeting Allison on
	the Spanish temple shift.}.  \item Getting the impression to plan
		a Gospel Principles lesson a week in advance even though I am
		not the teacher, and then getting called on the day before to
		substitute in it.  \end{itemize}

\section{Home Teaching}

Note, Church, 2009.02.01: If we don't do home teaching we will
retrogress in the gospel.

Note, Church, 2009.02.01: Fear: we can be held responsible for the
sins of others.

\subsection{Watch-Care}

\subsubsection{What is the Definition of Watch-Care?}

I searched in a couple online dictionaries and found nothing.
Further it is spelled in a couple different ways throughout LDS.org.
Therefore I am concluding that it is not a real word.  It is simply
a compound word to express the idea of watching a family to see if
they need anything and then to care for that need when the time
comes.  For example, when the home teachers have come to my
apartment in the past, I haven't needed them to care for me; I care
for myself; if something came up and I needed their help, they would
help--that is, they would care for that need.  I know of no other
word which encapsulates this idea, therefore ``watch-care'' seems
like an appropriate creation.

\subsection{Quotes on Home Teaching}

D\&C 20:53`: The teacher's duty is to watch over the church always,
and be with and strengthen them;

\vspace{1 em}

Ezra Taft Benson, ``‘Strengthen Thy Stakes','' \textit{Ensign}, Jan
1991, 2 \begin{quote} Priesthood holders need to provide watchcare
	over quorum members and their families through organized home
	teaching. We should have an interest in every fellow member of the
	Church to whom we may be assigned and who does not fully
	participate in Church activity.  \end{quote}

M. Russell Ballard, ``O Be Wise,'' \textit{Liahona}, Nov 2006, 17-20
\begin{quote} Home teaching is about love of people and service to
	and watchcare over our Heavenly Father's children.  \end{quote}

\subsection{Quotes on Visiting Teaching Related to Watch-Care}

Spencer W. Kimball, ``A Vision of Visiting Teaching,''
\textit{Ensign}, June 1978, 24.  \begin{quote} ``Your duties in many
	ways must be like those of the home teachers, which briefly are
	‘to watch over the church always'---not twenty minutes a month but
	always---‘and be with and strengthen them'---not a knock at the
	door, but to be with them, and lift them and strengthen them, and
	empower them, and fortify them.'' \end{quote}

\textit{LDS.org}, ``What You Wanted to Know About Visiting
Teaching'', accessed 2010.11.15 \begin{quote} Visiting teachers
	provide watchcare for their sisters. Watchcare is more than a
	brief visit or a pleasant conversation. Watchcare is caring for
	the spiritual and temporal welfare of the sisters and their
	families. Visiting teachers build caring relationships by
	developing friendship and trust with each sister they visit (see
	\textit{Church Handbook of Instructions}, Book 2, 203).
\end{quote}

\section{Honesty}

Marcos A. Aidukaitis, ``Honesty in the Small Things,''
\textit{Ensign}, Sep 2003, 28 \begin{quote} Scriptural teachings on
	honesty are clear, but unfortunately the world seems to be much
	more flexible. The world even classifies people according to
	different levels of honesty. Sometimes we hear of people who are
	``very'' honest, ``mostly'' honest, or even ``a little'' honest.
	Should we even use modifiers with the word honest? I don't believe
	so. There are no degrees of honesty. Either we are honest or we
	aren't. It is the same with cancer. Either we have the disease or
	we don't.  Many people rationalize committing ``small'' acts of
	dishonesty such as keeping extra change they receive in the
	grocery store, taking home supplies from the workplace, being less
	than accurate on tax returns, disobeying copyright laws, and so
	on. Yet even so-called small errors need to be eradicated from our
	lives, for anytime we are dishonest, we are breaking one of the
	Lord's commandments.  And as the scriptures tell us, ``there
	cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God'' (1 Ne.
	15:34).  \end{quote}

\subsection{``Fakeness''}

\textit{From my missionary study journal} \begin{itemize} \item True
		to the Faith, ``Honesty'' \item Matt. 23:25, 27: Pharisees \item
		3 Ne. 12:37 (33-37) \item Christ was ``real''; we can therefore
			trust Him (Prov. 3:5-6) \item Moro. 7:44-46: Being honest
			implies being charitable; without charity we are nothing \item
				John 6: ``I am the bread of life'' \end{itemize}

\subsection{Self-Honesty}

Note 2009.02.01: It's amazing how we can lie to ourselves and begin
to believe in our own lies.

\section{The Internet and Digital Media}

\subsubsection{Summary, 2013.04.19}

I read an article in the {\it Ensign} about disconnecting.  It is
important to get time ``under the radar'' where we are disconnected
from electronics so that we can receive promptings of the Spirit.
Further, on addiction, I read the following quote: \begin{quote}
	There are many activities that can become so absorbing that they
	rob participants of spiritual, intellectual, and social
	development.  \end{quote}

\section{Melchizedek}

Melchizedek or Malki Tzedek (from Hebrew malk-i s\'{e}deq) translated
as "my king (is) righteous(ness)")

\subsection{Who Was Melchizedek?}

From \textit{Mormon Doctrine}, ``Melchizedek''
\begin{quote}
Alma 13:19: Of all God's ancient high priests "none were greater."

His position in the priestly hierarchy of God's earthly kingdom was like unto
that of Abraham (Heb. 7:4-10), his contemporary whom he blessed (Gen. 14:18-20;
Heb. 7:1; Inspired Version, Gen. 14:17-40), and upon whom he conferred the
priesthood. (D. \& C. 84:14.)

Both bore the titles, Prince of Peace and King of Heaven - meaning King of Peace
(Alma 13:18; Inspired Version, Gen. 14:33, 36)

Alma tells us that "Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his
people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone
astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness; But Melchizedek having
exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according
to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold,
they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days;
therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and
he did reign under his father." (Alma 13:17-18.)

Paul, very obviously knowing much more about Melchizedek than he happened to
record in his epistles, gave as an illustration of great faith some unnamed
person who "wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
lions, Quenched the violence of fire." (Heb. 11:33-34.) From the Prophet's
inspired additions to the Old Testament we learn that Paul's reference was to
Melchizedek. "Now Melchizedek was a man of faith, who wrought righteousness; and
when a child he feared God, and stopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the
violence of fire." (Inspired Version, Gen. 14:26.)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Melchizedek and Shem}

D\&C 84:14: Abraham received the priesthood through Melchizedek, who received
it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah.

This implies (my interpretation) that Melchizedek was number one in the
patriarchal line at this time.

After Noah died, Shem would have been number one in the patriarchal line.

Jasher 16:11: ``And Adonizedek king of Jerusalem, the same was Shem, went out
with his men to meet Abram and his people, with bread and wine, and they
remained together in the valley of Melech.''

The Book of Jasher is apocryphal. From the online text where I copied this
verse:
\begin{quote}
	``This is one of the apochrypal Books of Jasher. There are several (as
many as five) separate works by this title, all composed much later than
Biblical times. This particular one is a translation of a Hebrew book printed in
1613. Sepir Ha Yasher, the Hebrew title of this book, means the 'Book of the
Upright', or 'the Upright or Correct Record'. This title was misread as
'Jasher', and at some point Jasher was treated as a proper name; however the
pronoun 'the' (hebrew 'ha') never preceeds proper names.

	``There is also another spurious Book of Jasher, published 1750,
	in which Jasher is treated as the name of the author.

	``This text covers much of the same ground as the traditional Mosaic
books of the Bible, from the creation of the world to the death of Moses, albeit
with several minor variations.''
\end{quote}

(According to \textit{Wikipedia}) John Taylor endorsed the theory that
Melchizedek was Shem

Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{Mormon Doctrine}: The line ``lineage of his fathers''
suggests to him that there ``at least two generations between Melchizedek and
Shem.''

Note, 2013.12.01: In Alma 13:18, we read that Melchizedek ``did
reign under his father''.

\section{Millennium}

\subsection{How is Satan bound in the Millennium?}

\textit{The Millennial Messiah}, p. 668:
Elder McConkie says that Satan will be bound by people choosing righteousness.
He makes the following points:
\begin{itemize}
 \item God did not bind Satan in the pre-mortal life because he lets Satan have
his agency.
 \item Later [p. 695-96] Elder McConkie talks about Satan being loosed
corresponding to
men ceding to apostasy and listening to him.  Elder McConkie notes that in 4th
Nephi the people were not influenced by Satan for a long time.
 \item In this way, the Book of Mormon mirrors the Millennium.  3rd Nephi is
like the
2nd coming and 4th Nephi is like the Millennium.  Mormon, then, is like the
final battle.
 \item Elder McConkie postulates that the post-millennium period in which Satan
is
bound will be 1,000 years.
\end{itemize}

question: how is this?  is the millennium + post-millennium like having a long
terrestrial period?

\subsection{Scripture Chain}

\begin{itemize}
 \item 1 Ne 22:15: No power because the wicked will be burned
 \item 1 Ne 22:26: No power because of the righteousness of the people
 \item Rev 20:1-3: [Symbolic] An angel will chain the dragon, cast him in a pit,
and he will be bound for a thousand years.  After that, he will be loosed for a
season.
 \item D\&C 88:110: When the angel sounds his trump for the 7th seal, Satan
will be bound
 \item D\&C 101:28: Satan shall not have power to tempt any man
 \item Just because we are righteous doesn't mean we can't be tempted.  For
example, Jesus was tempted (Heb. 4:15, Mosiah 3:7, TG: Jesus Christ, temptation
of)
 \item Idea: One possible interpretation is that Satan can't tempt man,
therefore he
has no power.  Satan has power today in more ways than just the power to tempt
us. (i.e. the church of the devil)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personal Lesson}

Lesson in humility: I am finding more sources which talk about Satan being bound
because people are righteous.  I had judged others who emphasized this point.
``Death'' during the Millennium

People in the Millennium will in fact pass on.  D\&C 101:29-31 talks about this.
It says that there will not be death like we know it, but when we are
``twinkled''
we will be caught up and received into our rest.
TPJS p. 268 says that immortal beings will frequently visit the earth.  This
wouldn't make sense if, like I had understood before, all resurrected people
just were here because no one would ``visit'' the earth.
In this sense, the Millennium will be a lot like life on earth today.

\subsection{Righteousness of the earth during the Millennium}

The wicked will be destroyed at the Second Coming and only Celestial and
Terrestrial level people will live on earth. (Gospel Principles, p. 263)
	People will still have agency. However, eventually everyone will confess
that Jesus Christ is the Savior. (Gospel Principles, p. 263)

\subsection{Christ will reign personally on the earth}

A of F 10 states this fact.  In TPJS p. 258, Joseph Smith said that ``Jesus will
reign over the saints and come down and instruct.''
	[Source?]  I read that Jesus will not dwell on the earth continually but
will make visits to the earth.  He will reign from heaven.

\subsection{Two World Capitals}

Jerusalem in the east and the New Jerusalem, or Zion (Independence, MO) in the
west.

Isa 2:3: ``for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out
of Jerusalem.''

Study 2010.11.12: the Hebrew roots indicate law refers to teaching or doctrine.
Contrary to what I had previously supposed, there appears to be no separation
between the two into a spiritual capital and a legal capital. (Am I sure?)

Ether 13: Jersualem for (scattered) Israel---recall that Jerusalem was promised
to Abraham and that the 10 tribes are to be restored---New Jerusalem for the
remnant of Joseph.
If I am interpreting this correctly, why would this be the design?
It is a symbol: Ether 13:6-9?
Joseph saved Israel and brought him to Egypt.
The Lord brought a remnant of Joseph out of Jerusalem and thereby saved them.

Old vs. New.
New = church today, Old = past traditions, etc.; the church is responsible for
the new city, the Jews for the old.
Zion will likely be built before the second coming.  Jerusalem exists even now.
First shall be last, last shall be first.

Fulfilling of covenants.
Joseph's is America.
Israel promised Canaan (restoration of the 10 tribes).

{\it Book of Mormon Reference Companion}:
Zion is also a holy city to be built on the American continent in the last days.

  This will be the New Jerusalem which will complement the original Jerusalem
existing in the eastern hemisphere. It will be a place of gathering for the

Enoch to come down to meet New Jerusalem? (Moses 7:63)

Jerusalem the first city after the flood? (``New Jerusalem,'' Mormon Doctrine)

Is it possible that there are more major holy cities to be built up after the
Second Coming?

Conclusion for now: there will be two because that's just how it will be.  There
is a lot of symbolism with it though.

\subsection{Will Little Children Be Tested There?}

Bruce R. McConkie, ``Salvation of Little Children,'' Tambuli, Mar 1978, 3

\begin{quote}
Absolutely not! Any idea that they will be tested in paradise or during the
millennium or after the millennium is pure fantasy. Why would a resurrected
being, who has already come forth from the grave with a celestial body and whose
salvation is guaranteed, be tested? Would the Lord test someone who cannot fail
the test and whose exaltation is guaranteed? For that matter, all those billions
of people who will be born during the millennium, when Satan is bound, ``shall
grow up without sin unto salvation'' (D\&C 45:58) and therefore will not be
tested. ``Satan cannot tempt little children in this life, nor in the spirit
world, nor after their resurrection. Little children who die before reaching the
years of accountability will not be tempted.'' (Doctrines of Salvation,
2:56-57.)
Such is the emphatic language of President Joseph Fielding Smith.

Joseph F. Smith, \textit{Gospel Doctrine}, pp. 455-56
\begin{quote}
``Joseph Smith taught the doctrine that the infant child that was laid away in
death would come up in the resurrection as a child; and, pointing to the mother
of a lifeless child, he said to her: ‘You will have the joy, the pleasure, and
satisfaction of nurturing this child, after its resurrection, until it reaches
the full stature of its spirit.' There is restitution, there is growth, there is
development, after the resurrection from death. I love this truth. It speaks
volumes of happiness, of joy and gratitude to my soul. Thank the Lord he has
revealed these principles to us.''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
It matters not whether these tabernacles mature in this world, or have to wait
and mature in the world to come, according to the word of the Prophet Joseph
Smith, the body will develop, either in time or in eternity, to the full stature
of the spirit, and when the mother is deprived of the pleasure and joy of
rearing her babe to manhood or to womanhood in this life, through the hand of
death, that privilege will be renewed to her hereafter, and she will enjoy it to
a fuller fruition than it would be possible for her to do here. When she does it
there, it will be with the certain knowledge that the results will be without
failure; whereas here, the results are unknown until after we have passed the
test.

Certainly. There can be no question about this. If they gain salvation, which is
eternal life, which is exaltation, it means that they are married and live in
the family unit. President Joseph Fielding Smith has so stated in plain words,
and it is something that must necessarily be so. (See Doctrines of Salvation,
2:49-57.)

When we contemplate the eternal nature of our choices, preparation is a vital
factor in our lives. The day will come when we will look upon our period of
preparation and be grateful that we properly applied ourselve	Many years ago,
before I was called to the Quorum of the Twelve, I had the opportunity to
address a business convention in Dallas, Texas---known as ``the city of
churches.''
After the convention I took a sightseeing bus ride about the city's suburbs. As
we would pass the beautiful churches, our driver would comment, ``On the left
you
see the Methodist church,'' or ``There on the right is the Catholic
cathedral.'' As
we passed a beautiful red brick building situated upon a hill, the driver
informed us, ``That building is where the Mormons meet.''

	A lady's voice from the rear of the bus asked, ``Driver, can you tell us
something about the Mormons?'' The driver pulled the bus over to the side of the
road, turned around in his seat, and replied, ``Lady, all I know about the
Mormons is that they meet in that red brick building. Is there anyone on this
bus who knows anything about the Mormons?''

	I gazed at the expression on each person's face for some sign of
recognition, some desire to comment. I found nothing---not a sign. Then I
realized
the truth of the statement ``When the time for decision arrives, the time for
preparation is past.'' For the next 15 minutes I had the privilege of giving, as
Peter declared, ``a reason [for] the hope that is in you'' (1 Peter 3:15). At
that

preparation.

\section{New and Everlasting Covenant}

\textit{Doctrine and Covenants Institute Manual}

\begin{quote}
 D\&C 132:3-6 . ``If Ye Abide Not That Covenant, Then Are Ye Damned''

The ``new and everlasting covenant'' ( D\&C 132:4 ) is the covenant of celestial
marriage, as President Spencer W. Kimball stated: ``Though relatively few people
in this world understand it, the new and everlasting covenant is the marriage
ordinance in the holy temple by the properly constituted leaders who hold the
genuine, authoritative keys. This glorious blessing is available to men and
women on this earth.'' ( ``Temples and Eternal Marriage,'' Ensign, Aug. 1974,
p. 5
.)

D\&C 132:19-22 . How Does an Individual Obtain a Fulness of God's Glory?

The revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants include all of the laws necessary
for exaltation. If we keep the law revealed in section 132 and all the other
laws, such as faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost, we can
be exalted.

Celestial marriage is a covenant, a contract between the two marriage partners
and the Lord. Covenants have ``if-then'' clauses: if we keep certain
commandments,
then the Lord promises us certain blessings. Verses 19-22 form such a clause.

If a couple---Then they will---

1. Are married in accordance with the Lord's law---``Inherit thrones, kingdoms,
principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths'' ( v. 19 )

2. Are married by one who has the keys of the priesthood---``Pass by the
angels''
to
their exaltation ( v. 19 )

3. Have their marriage sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise---Be gods for all
eternity (see v. 20 )

4. Abide in the covenant---Have a ``continuation of the lives'' ( v. 22 )

Some members of the Church mistakenly believe that marriage in the temple
fulfills the requirements of the covenant. But marriage in the temple fulfills
only the first two parts of the covenant. Having one's marriage sealed by the
Holy Spirit of Promise requires a lifelong commitment to righteousness (see
Notes and Commentary on D\&C 132:7). Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught that
``baptism is the gate to the celestial kingdom; celestial marriage is the gate
to
an exaltation in the highest heaven within the celestial world. ( D. \& C.
131:1-4 .) To gain salvation after baptism it is necessary to keep the
commandments of God and endure to the end ( 2 Ne. 31:17-21 ); to gain exaltation
after celestial marriage it is necessary to continue the same devotion and
righteousness. Those who have been married in the temples for eternity know that
the ceremony itself expressly conditions the receipt of all promised blessings
upon the subsequent faithfulness of the husband and wife.

``Making one's calling and election sure is an addition to celestial marriage
and
results from undeviating and perfect devotion to the cause of righteousness.
Those married in the temple can never under any circumstances gain exaltation
unless they keep the commandments of God and abide in the covenant of marriage
which they have taken upon themselves.'' ( Mormon Doctrine, p. 118.)

called prophets directly to complete missions.  Finally, the church is organized
in its current form.

We don't need to go all the way up to the general authorities with our questions

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Ezra Taft Benson, "``Strengthen Thy Stakes''", Ensign, Jan. 1991, 2
\begin{quote}
Each stake, presided over by three high priests and supported by twelve men
known as a high council, becomes a miniature Church to the Saints in a specific
geographic area. The purpose is to unify and perfect the members who live in
those boundaries by extending to them the Church programs, the ordinances, and
gospel instruction.

Members of stakes are to be models, or standards, of righteousness.
Stakes are to be a defense. They do this as stake members unify under their
local priesthood officers and consecrate themselves to do their duty and keep
their covenants. Those covenants, if kept, become a protection from error, evil,
or calamity.

	We only build temples in stakes. The blessings and ordinances of the
temple prepare one for exaltation. Of course, it is not possible for every stake
to have a temple, but we are presently witnessing some remarkable---yes,
miraculous---developments in the building of temples in different parts of the
world. Such a program permits members of the Church to receive the full
blessings of the Lord.

Stakes are a refuge from the storm to be poured out over the earth.

\section{Planning}

\textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 137

\begin{quote}
 You will be expected to devote all your time and attention to serving the
Lord, leaving behind all other personal affairs.
\end{quote}

{\it Note, 2013.04.20:} for the above quote, the mission is unique in that we
are devoted to one thing.  In real life, we are devoted to many things.  I
personally have found this hard because when one is giving all to a single
cause, one feels productive (and happy).  In my life, I have given up an
endeavor in which I would have given a lot of devotion (becoming an academic
mathematician) because of the other (more important) matters in which I am
involved.


\subsection{Goal Setting}

\textit{Preach My Gospel}, p. 146

\begin{quote}
Goals reflect the desires of our hearts and our vision of what we can
accomplish.
\end{quote}

{\it Thought:}
Effective goal setting and completing is difficult; it is something I have yet
to master.

\subsubsection*{Thought, 2013.04.20} Something which has helped me over
the past couple weeks is desire.  As I set goals these past two weeks, I have
done so with resolute commitment to keeping them. I decided that I really
wanted
to make and, more importantly, keep a few goals.

Goals reflect the desires of our hearts, as quoted above.  I had had a hard
time taking the desires of my heart and converting them to action.  I had
become implicitly convinced that it was OK to be lax with my goals and be lazy.
 I finally decided to invest in the desires of my heart and topple the desires
of the natural man.

\subsubsection{Note, Church, 2013.04.21}

During a lesson in Elders Quorum which touched on goal setting, a comment was
made about using motivational mechanisms to encourage one to complete goals.
For example, one could automatically have money deducted from one's account and
donated to some loathsome cause if he failed to keep his goal.
This contrasted with what I have been doing for the past couple weeks.
For me, if I set a goal, the act of setting a goal should be enough motivation
to keep it.  I am changing a lot of my choices away from the more comfortable
choice to the better choice.

For example, I know that it is good to wake early
and go to bed early. Because it is in the scriptures (D\&C 88:124) it is
actually very clear that waking and sleeping early is good.  On the other hand,
for a long time I had not been doing it, i.e.\ most of my post-mission life.
It is comfortable and stimulating to stay up late; it is very comfortable to
sleep late, especially if one had slept in late---I am a strong believer in at
least getting 8 or so hours of daily sleep.  So is the allure of sleeping late
and rising late more appealing than keeping the rule laid out in D\&C 88:124?
From a logical point of view, no of course not; in the long view of things I
feel better when I sleep and rise early.  Am I so weak that when faced with a
choice of an easy bad decision and a hard good decision, I am obligated to take
the easy?  I have decided, at least in this case and at least at this time,
that no, I am not so weak.

The final thought is that when crossing over from lazy to diligent, I had
originally planned to do it for a week only.  However, everything that I
planned to do for just a week was something that I thought was good for me, and
I really felt happy being diligent.  As a result, I extended my plan to do it
for just one week to a plan for doing it every week.

Note, 2012.11.07: I have had a bad experience with this election cycle getting
worked up over others contrary opinions. (This includes, actually, contrary
opinions on the church.)  It caused a ``spirit of contention'' for me.

\section{Pondering}

Thought 2011.06.09
\begin{quote}
Pondering on the scriptures is important and is often overlooked by me.  I often
think about scripture study as just keeping myself busy immersed in some kind of
scriptures.  Perhaps that ignores the point of scripture study--or studying in
general.

The general study point I miss by not pondering is that studying is not an end
but is a means to an end.  Study goals such as study for a half an hour or read
5 pages per day are useful but imperfect; they are useful because they are the
easiest to measure and carry out; they are imperfect because they have nothing
to do with the end goal.

In scripture study what is the end goal?  It can be that one needs to prepare
some kind of talk or lesson, but in my case, as someone who does not have to
give talks and lessons, what is the goal?  This is an interesting topic in and
of itself, and I don't have a complete answer.  My first thought is that the
goal of this life is to gain eternal life; therefore the goal of scripture study
should tie into me gaining eternal life.

The scripture specific element I miss by not pondering is revelation.  One does
not truly learn while studying the scriptures without receiving revelation.  And
how can one receive revelation without pondering; things of the spirit typically
do not come without our minds and hearts being opened.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Ordaining vs. Conferring}

This question was raised because of the following passage:
JS-H 1:68-71:
\begin{quote}
68 We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month (May,
1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord
respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the
translation of the plates. While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon
the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid
his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:

  69 Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the
Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of
the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins;
and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do
offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.

  70 He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for
the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter;
and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should
baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.

  71 Accordingly we went and were baptized. I baptized him first, and afterwards
he baptized me---after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to
the
Aaronic Priesthood, and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to
the same Priesthood---for so we were commanded.
\end{quote}

Why were they ordained, baptized, then ordained?

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent ``Priesthood,'' True to the Faith, (2004),124-28
\begin{quote}
For a male member of the Church to hold the priesthood, an authorized priesthood
holder must confer it on him and ordain him to an office in that priesthood.
\end{quote}

\noindent Guide to the Scriptures, ``Ordain, Ordination''
\begin{quote}
To appoint or confer authority or office. To use authority in the Lord's Church,
a person must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by
those who are in authority (A of F 1: 5). Although a person may receive
authority by ordination, he uses it under the direction of those who hold the
particular keys for that authority.
\end{quote}

\noindent Larry C. Porter, ``The Restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek
Priesthoods,'' Ensign, Dec 1996, 30-47
\begin{quote}
John the Baptist's procedure in ordaining Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to the
Aaronic Priesthood involved, first, his conferring the priesthood upon them,
followed by their baptizing each other and then his instructing them to lay
hands on each other and confer the priesthood that the angel had recently
bestowed. Among the reasons suggested for this unusual pattern, other than ``for
so we were commanded,'' are the following:
\end{quote}

\noindent Joseph Fielding Smith, Essentials in Church History, 27th ed. (1974),
58
\begin{quote}
``First, to confer the Priesthood before baptism, is contrary to the order of
the
organized Church, therefore they were commanded to confer the Priesthood upon
each other in the regular way; after they were baptized. Second, the angel did
for them that which they could not do for themselves. There was no one living in
mortality who held the keys of this Priesthood, therefore it was necessary that
this messenger, who held the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood in the Dispensation
of the Meridian of Time, should be sent to confer this power. It is contrary to
the order of heaven for those who have passed beyond the veil to officiate and
labor for the living on the earth, only wherein mortal man cannot act, and
thereby it becomes necessary for those who have passed through the resurrection
to act for them. Otherwise John would have followed the regular order, which is
practiced in the Church, and would have first baptized Joseph Smith and Oliver
Cowdery and then conferred upon them the Aaronic Priesthood.''
\end{quote}

\noindent Personal Insight:
The first act was restoring to the earth the priesthood keys.  Without this, how
could there be baptism?

\subsection{My Line of Authority}

\indent \indent I, Christopher Nelson, was ordained an Elder 30 Mar 2003 by
William C. Knudsen,

who was ordained a high priest 20 June 1970 by John H. Vandenburg,

who was ordained a high priest 26 June 1942 by Albert E. Bowen,

who was ordained an apostle 8 April 1937 by Heber J. Grant,

who was ordained an apostle 16 October 1882 by George Q. Cannon,

who was ordained an apostle 26 August 1860 by Brigham Young,

who was ordained an apostle 14 February 1835 under the hands of the three

witnesses, Oliver Cowdrey, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris.

The three witnesses were called by revelation to choose the twelve apostles on
14 February 1835. They were blessed by the laying on of hands of the presidency,
Joseph Smith, Jr., Sidney Rigdon, and Frederick G. Williams, to ordain the
twelve apostles (HC 2:187-88.)

Joseph Smith, Jr., and Oliver Cowdery received the Melchizedek Priesthood 1829
under the hands of Peter, James, and John.

Peter, James, and John were ordained apostles by the Lord Jesus Christ.

\subsection{Inordinate Church Service}

Elder Dallin H. Oaks, "Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall," \textit{Ensign},
Oct. 1994
\begin{quote}
"A related strength that can be corrupted to our downfall is a desire to excel
in a Church calling. I remember a graduate student who used his Church service
as a means of escape from the rigors of his studies. He went beyond what we call
Church-service time and became almost a full-time Church-service worker. He
consistently volunteered for every extra assignment, giving help that was
greatly appreciated in the various organizations and activities of the Church.
As a result of this inordinate allocation of time, he failed in his studies and
then mistakenly blamed his failure on the excessive burden of Church service.
His strength became his downfall.

	``Similarly, I remember the concerns President Harold B. Lee expressed
to
me when I was president of BYU. Shortly before the Provo Temple was dedicated,
he told me of his concern that the accessibility of the temple would cause some
BYU students to attend the temple so often that they would neglect their
studies. He urged me to work with the BYU stake presidents to make sure the
students understood that even something as sacred and important as temple
service needed to be done in wisdom and order so that students would not neglect
the studies that should be the major focus of their time during their student
years."
\end{quote}

\subsection{More Money Equals Less Time}

Lynn G. Robbins, ``The Cost of Riches,'' \textit{Ensign}, Jun 2003, 24
\begin{quote}
Juliet B. Schor, who teaches economics at Harvard University, says that due to
improvements in productivity, Americans could work 22-hour workweeks if they
were satisfied with a 1948 standard of living. While we are certainly grateful
for the progress made since 1948, that would give many of us at least 18 extra
hours per week!

In the book \textit{Your Money or Your Life}, the authors convincingly
illustrate how everything we buy consumes a part of our life---hence the title
of their book. Applying simple math to an hourly wage, for example, can
illustrate how upgrading to a bigger home (or an unnecessary home equity loan on
an existing home) could cost an extra 5 or 10 years of life to purchase,
depending on its cost. And if not 10 years of the father's life, then perhaps 10
years of the mother's life as a second wage earner. When we spend beyond what is
sufficient, the trade-off is less time.

It has been said that a rich man doesn't own his things; rather, his things
begin to own him. ``A thatched roof once covered free men; under marble and gold
dwells slavery.'' In his book Clutter's Last Stand, Don Aslett gives us
additional insight into this self-imposed slavery. Each item we accumulate, he
says, ``stifles us and robs us of freedom because it requires so much of our
time
to tend.'' He writes further: ``We have to pay for it, keep track of it, protect
it, clean it, store it, insure it, and worry about it. … Later we have to move
it, hide it, apologize for it, argue over it. … But these things are valuable,
you say? What about the value of the life and time to store, to clean, to
insure, to transport, to protect---what does that cost? More than money.''

``Approaching Mormon Doctrine'', SALT LAKE CITY, 4 May 2007
\begin{quote}
	``Not every statement made by a Church leader, past or present,
necessarily constitutes doctrine. A single statement made by a single leader on
a single occasion often represents a personal, though well-considered, opinion,
but is not meant to be officially binding for the whole Church. With divine
inspiration, the First Presidency (the prophet and his two counselors) and the
Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (the second-highest governing body of the Church)
counsel together to establish doctrine that is consistently proclaimed in
official Church publications. This doctrine resides in the four ``standard
works''
of scripture (the Holy Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants and
the Pearl of Great Price), official declarations and proclamations, and the
Articles of Faith. Isolated statements are often taken out of context, leaving
their original meaning distorted.''

``Persecution is an essential part of the creeds of all false religions.'' (MM

serve Satan, whose prophets and ministers they are

are all corrupt

teach false doctrines

teachings deny God and the Godhead

teachings destroy the family unit and deny the purposes of God

malign Joseph Smith, fight against the Book of Mormon, and deny the restoration
of the gospel

teach with their learning rather than by the power of the Holy Ghost.

teach for hire and divine for money

do not raise the warning voice and cry repentance

prophesy falsely

perform false ordinances that have no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after
the resurrection

do not receive revelation, see visions, entertain angels, and see the face of
God

deny the gifts of the Spirit and latter-day miracles

do not have the testimony of Jesus, which is the spirit of prophecy

promote carnal and evil causes that are not of God

do not hold priesthood

engage in priestcrafts

work false miracles and engage in sorceries, witchcrafts, and magic

are leaders of apostate groups that have broken away from the true Church
\end{quote}

\subsection{Role of the Prophet in Different Eras}

I have a question about the role of the prophet in different eras.
I already know that in different eras the prophet has been a
different responsibility.  I am thinking about the difference when a
prophet is in charge of a church and not, and when a prophet brings
forth scripture and not.

I know however that the prophet today is called to lead the church
and is inspired of the Lord.

\subsection{Personal Experiences}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Basic things: Word of Wisdom, Law of Chastity, Law of Tithing
 \item 2 Tim. 1:7-8: Gordon B. Hinckley suggested that we read it every day; as
I have done that I have felt strength in remembering that "God hath not given us
the spirit of fear" and to not be "ashamed of the testimony of our Lord."
 \item Following local leaders:
Bishop told us to dedicate our homes; as I left my apartment, which I had
dedicated, I felt a great sense that God had protected and watched over me
there, and that part of this was through dedicating my home.
 \item Bishop told us to go to dance; I wouldn't have otherwise gone; I received
such confidence and power from that experience; even though I didn't marry the
girl I asked to the dance---or even go on another date with her---I was able to
get out on more dates in the months that followed than I normally would have
gone on.

BD, "Repentance"
\begin{quote}
The Greek word of which this is the translation denotes a change of mind, i.e.,
a fresh view about God, about oneself, and about the world. Since we are born
into conditions of mortality, repentance comes to mean a turning of the heart
and will to God, and a renunciation of sin to which we are naturally inclined.
\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Wikipedia.org}, ``Repentance'', accessed 2010.11.15
\begin{quote}
In Biblical Hebrew, the idea of repentance is represented by two verbs: shuv
(to return) and nicham (to feel sorrow). In the New Testament, the word
translated as 'repentance' is the Greek word (metanoia), "after/behind
one's mind", which is a compound word of the preposition 'meta' (after, with),
and the verb 'noeo' (to perceive, to think, the result of perceiving or
observing). In this compound word the preposition combines the two meanings of
time and change, which may be denoted by 'after' and 'different'; so that the
whole compound means: 'to think differently after'. Metanoia is therefore
primarily an after-thought, different from the former thought; a change of mind
accompanied by regret and change of conduct, "change of mind and heart", or,
"change of consciousness". A description of repentance in the New Testament can
be found in the parable of the prodigal son found in the Gospel of Luke (15
beginning at verse 11).

If we are not progressing as fast as we should be, we need to repent.

\noindent Note, Study, 2011.06.22:
I read in Faith Preceeds the Miracle about when Spencer W. Kimball was called to
be an apostle.  He went through a period of purification to make himself worthy
to serve.  I thought about how anyone can choose to purify themselves and live a
little better.


\subsection{Personal Experiences}

Scripture study: I studied for a while about scripture study.  My attitudes
about it changed through this self-examination.  I realized later that this
study was a form of repentance.

\section{Restoration of the Gospel}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Spring 1820: First Vision
 \item Book of Mormon
 \item John the Baptist: Aaronic Priesthood
 \item Peter, James, and John: Melchizedek Priesthood
 \item 6 April 1830: Church organized
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Angels who Came Down to Restore the Gospel}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Moroni (B. of M.)
 \item John the Baptist (Aaronic Priesthood)
 \item Peter, James and John (Melchizedek Priesthood; keys?)
 \item the voice of Michael (i.e. Adam), Gabriel (i.e. Noah), and Raphael
(personal thought: one of the prophets of a dispensation) (D\&C 128:21)
 \item Moses (keys of the gathering of Israel: D\&C 110:10)
 \item Elias (dispensation of the gospel of Abraham)
\begin{itemize}
 \item Institute Manual, D\&C 110:12: We don't know who this is exactly.  We
just know what the title ``Elias'' means.
\end{itemize}
 \item Elijah (keys of ``this'' dispensation)l I interpret this to mean the
current dispensation because this is supposed toopen up the work for the dead
(Mal 4:5-6) which occurs in no other dispensation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Joseph Smith's Mission}

\noindent Bruce R. McConkie, \textit{The Millenial Messiah}, p. 331:
He splits Joseph Smith's mission into two facets. (1) He restored truth and (2)
he restored authority.

\subsection{Internet and the Gospel}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Thought:
The Internet is a blessing. It has made spreading the gospel message easier.
 \item Thought, 2010.09.13:
The Internet is a powerful tool.  It can be used for good or bad.
 \item Thought, 2012.10.07:
The Internet has just as easily been used to spread anti-Mormon material.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The Standard of Truth}
\begin{quote}
	``Our missionaries are going forth to different nations . . . the
Standard of Truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from
progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble,
calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and
independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept
every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be
accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.'' (History of
the
Church 4:540)
\end{quote}


\subsection{The Lord started restoring His church even before Joseph Smith.}

Boyd K. Packer, ``The Cloven Tongues of Fire,'' \textit{Ensign}, May 2000, 7
\begin{quote}
On April 6, 1830, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized.
The Brethren set about to teach and to baptize. Nine months later came a
correction, a revelation:
``Thou didst baptize by water unto repentance, but they received not the Holy
Ghost;
``But now I give unto thee a commandment, that thou shalt baptize by water, and
they shall receive the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands, even as the
apostles of old.'' (D\&C 35:5-6)
\end{quote}

\subsection{The First Vision}

What doctrines do we learn from the First Vision?

\vspace{1 em}

inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy''
 \item Joseph Smith:

present it pure before God in the Celestial Kingdom.  The great principle of
happiness consists in having a body.  The Devil has no body, and herein is his
punishment.'' The Words of Joseph Smith, ed. Andrew F. Ehat and Lyndon W. Cook

\subsection{Deep Doctrine: Resurrection Is an Ordinance}

Brigham Young, \textit{Discourses of Brigham Young}, p. 372.
\begin{quote}
	``When the angel who holds the keys of the resurrection shall sound his
trumpet, then the peculiar fundamental particles that organized our bodies here,
if we do honor to them, though they be deposited in the depths of the sea, and
though one particle is in the north, another in the south, another in the east,
and another in the west, will be brought together again in the twinkling of an
eye, and our spirits will take possession of them.''
\end{quote}

Brigham Young, Aug. 24, 1872, \textit{Journal of Discourses} 15:137
\begin{quote}
	``It is supposed by this people that we have all the ordinances in our
possession for life and salvation, and exaltation, and that we are administering
in these ordinances. This is not the case.

	We are in possession of all the ordinances that can be administered in
the flesh; but there are other ordinances and administrations that must be
administered beyond this world. I know you would ask what they are.

	I will mention one. We have not, neither can we receive here, the
ordinance and the keys of the resurrection. They will be given to those who have
passed off this stage of action and have received their bodies again, as many
have already done and many more will. They will be ordained, by those who hold
the keys of the resurrection, to go forth and resurrect the Saints, just as we
receive the ordinance of baptism, then the keys of authority to baptize others
for the remission of their sins. This is one of the ordinances we can not
receive here, and there are many more.''
\end{quote}

Wilford Woodruff, in Susan Staker, ed., \textit{Waiting for the World's End: The
Diaries of Wilford Woodruff}, pp.168-169.
\begin{quote}
	``Who will resurrect Joseph's Body? It will be Peter, James, John,
Moroni, or someone who has or will receive the keys of the resurrection. It will
probably be one of those who hold the keys of this dispensation and has
delivered them to Joseph and you will see Jesus and he will eat peaches and
apples with you. But the world will not see it or know it for wickedness will
increase. Joseph and Jesus will be there. They will walk and talk with them at
times and no man mistrusts who they are. Joseph will lead the Armies of Israel
whether He is seen or no, whether visible or invisible as seemeth him good.

Joseph has got to receive the keys of the resurrection for you and I.
After he is resurrected he will go and resurrect Brother Brigham, Brother Heber,
and Brother Carloss, and when that is done then He will say, "now go Brother
Brigham and resurrect your wives and children and gather them together. While
this is done, the wicked will know nothing of it, though they will be in our
midst and they will be struck with fear. This is the way the resurrection will
be. All will not be raised at once but will continue in this way until all the
righteous are resurrected.

	After Joseph comes to us in his resurrected body, He will more fully
instruct us concerning the baptism for the dead and the sealing ordinances. He
will say, be baptized for this man and that man and that man be sealed to that
such a man to such a man, and connect the Priesthood together. I tell you their
will not be much of this done until Joseph comes$\ldots$. Our hearts are already
turned to him and his to us.''

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Example of former BYU star who turned down NFL:
His name is Eli Herring.  A quick search turns up articles about him.  It is an
intriguing choice and something I can support because I know that as a result he
gets an easier and more spiritually-enriched life.

\vspace{1 em}

Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught that ``Sabbath observance was a sign between
ancient Israel and their God whereby the chosen people might be
known.''\footnote{Bruce R. McConkie, \it{Mormon Doctrine}, 2nd ed. [1966], 658;
see also Neh. 13:15–22; Isa. 56:1–8; Jer. 17:19–27; Ezek. 46:1–7; Ex. 31:12–17.}

President Gordon B. Hinckley expressed concern that members of the Church may
have a tendency to take on the ways of the world. He said: ``We don't adopt them
immediately, but we slowly take them on, unfortunately. I wish I had the power
to convert this whole Church to the observance of the Sabbath. I know our people
would be more richly blessed of the Lord if they would walk in faithfulness in
the observance of the Sabbath.''\footnote{Heber City/Springville Utah regional
conference, priesthood leadership meeting, 13 May 1995.}

\subsection{Personal Experiences}

Not going to Olympics on Sunday.

\subsubsection{Blessings}

Thought, 2012.11.20

I had the thought that one of the blessings of Sabbath observance is success in
my academic endeavors. Not working on Sunday hasn't stopped me from succeeding
in school.

\section{Satan}

\subsection{Satan Can Perform Miracles}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Ex. 7:11: The ``magicians of Egypt'' could copy some of Moses' miracles.
 \item Rev. 13:11-18: The beast deceived ``them that dwell on the earth by the
means of those miracles''
 \item Rev. 16:13-14: The ``spirits of devils, working miracles$\ldots$''
 \item Matt. 24:24: ``false Christs, and false prophets$\ldots$shall shew great
signs
and wonders$\ldots$''
 \item Matt. 7:22-23: The Lord will reject some who do miracles in His name
 \item Matt. 12:22-30: The Pharisees accused Jesus of doing miracles by the
power of the devil (also Mark 3:22, Luke 11:15)
\end{itemize}

\noindent Old Testament Manual
\begin{quote}
Exodus 7:11-12 . Did the Magicians in the Pharaoh's Court Exercise the Power of
the Lord?

``All down through the ages and in almost all countries, men have exercised
great
occult and mystical powers, even to the healing of the sick and the performing
of miracles. Soothsayers, magicians, and astrologers were found in the courts of
ancient kings. They had certain powers by which they divined and solved the
monarch's problems, dreams, etc. One of the most striking examples of this is
recorded in Exodus, where Pharaoh called ‘the wise men and the sorcerers' who
duplicated some of the miracles the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron to
perform. When Aaron threw down his rod, it became a serpent. The Egyptian
magicians threw down their rods, and they also became serpents. . . .
``. . . The Savior declared that Satan had the power to bind bodies of men and
women and sorely afflict them [see Matthew 7:22-23 ; Luke 13:16 ]. If Satan has
power to bind the bodies, he surely must have power to loose them. It should be
remembered that Satan has great knowledge and thereby can exercise authority and
to some extent control the elements, when some greater power does not
intervene.'' (Smith, Answers to Gospel Questions, 1:176, 178.)

My scripture study is for my personal edification.  It is not for prideful
purposes.

\noindent Thoughts 2013.08.24
Just as we are asked to sacrifice time for the Sabbath day, we are
asked to sacrifice time to study the scriptures.  The natural man in
us would rather spend our time on fun things, or even on work.  I
know that the Lord blesses us when we sacrifice our time to fulfill
his will.  Further, I know that the Lord blesses us when we have a
sincere scripture study.

\begin{quote}
Much, much more can and should be said about striving to become a gospel
scholar. Elder Bruce R. McConkie once went on to list other keys for unlocking
the gospel truths in the scriptures: learn of local customs and traditions,
distinguish between literal and figurative passages, and of course, ponder,
pray, and seek the spirit. All of this lays out a lifetime of rewarding
learning.

No one should expect to become a gospel scholar overnight. President Ezra Taft
Benson admonished faithful members of the Church to make the study of the
scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon, a lifetime pursuit. A gospel scholar
is always keenly aware of the distances yet to be traversed and yet is not
discouraged. The fact that scholarship is never finished gives new meaning in a
gospel setting to the commandment to "endure to the end." Eventually, being a
gospel scholar becomes less of a destination and more of a journey. The trip is
difficult at times, but it is doable and full of satisfying rewards.

Ultimately, the challenge is to look into your heart and decide that you really
want to walk the path of becoming a scripture scholar, eventually coming to love
the words, the principles, thoughts, and experiences on each page of scripture.

If you do, the human beings who stand behind those words will become welcome
friends in your life. Each verse or chapter will be cherished, like a dear
friend. Each time you open the scriptures, you will want to hear what your
friend has to say to you. You will remember those messages, each like a separate
picture in a treasured photo album.
\end{quote}

\subsection{What is the purpose of me studying?}

\subsubsection{How}

Russell M. Nelson, ``Four Steps to Learning,'' Tambuli, Sep 1989, 39
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
 \item "Have a great desire to know the truth."
\item "Study with an inquiring mind."
\item "Apply or practice your learning in your daily lives." [See notes on
``Applying
what you learn'']
\item "Pray for help."
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\noindent Note, Questions Section
\begin{itemize}
\item I have experiences with people who studied extra hours on their missions,
yet their knowledge wasn't as good as I would expect. What is the formula to
building a strong understanding of the gospel, if not hours of study. (In these
cases, the people were faithful. Is the prideful point of view that some people
simply are smarter than others the correct one in this case?)
	\begin{itemize}
\item  How do I gain more gospel knowledge?
		\begin{itemize}
                \item  From mission journal: Intensify prayer, ask
questions, see pieces of the puzzle which I don't quite understand.
		\item Thought (2009.10.20): We are taught to ``search,
ponder, and pray''. I learned in institute that many of the revelations in the
D\&C came after pondering the scriptures. It was also commented that it is
better to study for a set period of time than to force oneself to finish a block
of reading---one can ponder a single verse for an hour and gain more from one's
study than by reading without pondering.
		\item Thought (2010.10.11): The formula for effective
study in anything is not simply hours of study.  I have experienced firsthand in
college this idea.  I studied much less than others I have observed, yet I
studied ``smarter not harder.''  Is it that some people are simply smarter than
others?  I would say that it is the case that some people study in a more
efficient and effective way than others.  Anyone could adapt smart study skills
if taught correctly.

\noindent {\bf Desire.}

\begin{quote}
 {\it Preach My Gospel}, p. 17

 Getting good results from your study depends on having a strong desire to
learn, studying with ``real intent'', ``hunger[ing] and thirst[ing] after
righteousness`` and searching for answers to questions\ldots and concerns.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
 {\it Preach My Gospel}, p. 18

Ezra Taft Benson, ``Think on Christ,'' \textit{Ensign}, Apr. 1984, 11
\begin{quote}
``It is our privilege to store our memories with good and great thoughts and
bring them out on the stage of our minds at will. When the Lord faced His three
great temptations in the wilderness, He immediately rebutted the devil with
appropriate scripture which He had stored in His memory''
\end{quote}

\noindent Richard G. Scott, ``Four Fundamentals for Those Who Teach and Inspire
Youth,'' in Old Testament Symposium Speeches, 1987, 5
\begin{quote}
``There is a power that can change lives in the specific words recorded in the
standard works. That power is weakened when we paraphrase or alter the actual
wording. I therefore suggest that you encourage students to cite scripture
content with precision. All you do to encourage students to memorize selected
scriptures accurately will bring to bear in their lives the power of their
content.''
\end{quote}

\noindent Richard G. Scott, in Conference Report, Oct. 1999, 112; or Ensign,
Nov. 1999, 87-88
\begin{quote}
``I suggest that you memorize scriptures that touch your heart and fill your
soul
with understanding. When scriptures are used as the Lord has caused them to be
recorded, they have intrinsic power that is not communicated when paraphrased.
Sometimes when there is a significant need in my life, I review mentally
scriptures that have given me strength. There is great solace, direction, and
power that flow from the scriptures, especially the words of the Lord.''
\end{quote}

\noindent Spencer W. Kimball, in Conference Report, Oct. 1975, 119; or Ensign,
Nov. 1975, 79
\begin{quote}
``I am wondering how many of you know the Articles of Faith? How many of you big
men, as well as the little men? Do you know them? Have you repeated them? You
are always prepared with a sermon when you know the Articles of Faith. And they
are basic, aren't they? I'd think it would be a wonderful thing if all the boys,
as they learn them, would learn them word-perfect. That means that you don't
miss and you don't forget.

``Shall I tell you how I did it? . . . I used to milk cows. I typed with two
fingers, and I would type out these Articles of Faith on little cards and put
them down in the corral right by me when I sat on the one-legged stool and
milked the cows. And I repeated them over, I guess 20 million times. I don't
know. But at any rate, I have claimed that I could say the Articles of Faith now
after these many, many years and could say them word-perfect. And I think it has
been most valuable to me. Will you do that, my fine young men?''
\end{quote}

\subsection{What?}

Henry B. Eyring, ``A Discussion on Scripture Study,'' Ensign, Jul 2005, 22-26
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes I go to the scriptures for doctrine. Sometimes I go to the
scriptures for instruction. I go with a question, and the question usually is
``What would God have me do?'' or ``What would He have me feel?'' Invariably I
find
new ideas, thoughts I have never had before, and I receive inspiration and
instruction and answers to my questions.
\item Going to the scriptures to learn what to do makes all the difference. The
Lord
can teach us. When we come to a crisis in our life, such as losing a child or
spouse, we should go looking in the scriptures for specific help. We will find
answers in the scriptures. The Lord seemed to anticipate all of our problems and
all of our needs, and He put help in the scriptures for us---if only we seek it.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Gordon B. Hinckley, ``Feasting upon the Scriptures,'' Ensign, Dec
1985,
42
\begin{quote}
I do not claim distinction as a scholar of the scriptures. For me, the reading
of the scriptures is not the pursuit of scholarship. Rather, it is a love affair
with the word of the Lord and that of his prophets. They contain so much for
each of us.
\end{quote}

	My Take on this Quote: President Hinckley is emphasizing that learning
valuable gospel principles is more important than gaining knowledge of the
doctrine.

\subsubsection{Combating Apathy}

{\it Thought, 2013.04.15:} I have in the past long while had a hard time
getting excited about scripture study. In the past week and a half I have been
inspired to clean up many of my bad habits, and lack of scripture study is one
of those.

Part of my problem is that I didn't feel an urgent need to study the
scriptures.  On the one hand, I have an adequate understanding of the
principles of the gospel.  I am smart enough to understand things which are
said in church.  Therefore, I can adequately associate myself with church
members and not feel that I don't know enough about the gospel.
On the other hand, I have felt apathetic towards standing out in church.  I
haven't had a desire to make insightful comments in Sunday school.

As I have dedicated myself to studying every day, other than having the spirit
with me, I have found that I have actually learned a lot during my scripture
study.  It turns out that even though I have been through a mission, institute,
and years of personal scripture study, it has been as if there are tons of
things sitting on the surface for me to pick up and learn for the first time.
It is humbling.


\subsection{Family Scripture Study}

Henry B. Eyring, ``A Discussion on Scripture Study,'' Ensign, Jul 2005, 22-26
\begin{quote}
For me at least, and I think my six children would agree, scripture study works
well only if your children know you love the scriptures and they also know as
individuals that you love them. Then whatever pattern you have will work. If
scripture study is forced for either them or you, if your children feel pushed,
or if you don't really love the scriptures yourself, then scripture study
doesn't have as much power.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Applying what you learn}

PMG, p. 19: "Live What You Learn"
\begin{quote}
"Acting on what you have learned will bring added and enduring understanding."
\end{quote}

\noindent John 7:17
\begin{quote}
"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
God, or whether I speak of myself."
\end{quote}

\noindent PMG, p. 23: "Apply and Live What You Learn"
\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
  \item "Liken" what you learn to yourself (1 Nephi 19:23).
\item Set goals to live what you are learning.
\item Subsitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it.
\item Ask yourself, "How should I change as a result of what I have learned?"
Set appropriate goals.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Knowledge---Christlike Attribute}

\begin{itemize}
\item 2 Ne. 32:1-5: ``feast upon the words of Christ'', asking and knocking
\item Moro. 10:5: ``by the power of the Holy Ghost''
\item D\&C 46:61: ask
\item D\&C 76:5-10: serve
\item D\&C 88:118: by ``study and faith''
\item ``Knowledge'', BD: one of the attributes of God, essential for salvation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{We Can Gain/Lose Knowledge Through Righteousness/Lack of
Righteousness}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alma 12:9-11: God gives according to our heed and diligence
\item Matt. 13:11-15: Why the Savior taught in parables
\end{itemize}

\noindent Notes, Church, 2009.02.08
\begin{itemize}
\item Do you have the spirit of the school of the prophets?
\begin{itemize}
	\item In our day, this has been replaced by seminary, institute, the
MTC, etc.
\end{itemize}
\item ``We have no idea how much the Lord wants to teach us''
\item ``We need a church full of scholars in the gospel''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Marking the Scriptures}

Handout: Joseph Smith---Matthew with markings

\noindent Handout: Boyd K. Packer, ``Scriptures''

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Scripture Study Institute Manual
\begin{quote}
 Purposes of Marking Scripture
\begin{itemize}
\item To emphasize
\item To find quickly
\item To make the scriptures personal
\item To teach more easily from the scriptures
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Things I Like About Marking the Scriptures}

\begin{itemize}
 \item It aids visual learning
 \item It is a fast way to take notes on scripture study
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Personal Concerns About Marking the Scriptures}

\begin{itemize}
\item When one opens a marked set of scriptures, the markings imply to the mind
what is important in that passage.  This closes off, to a point, the other
insights to be gained from a passage
\begin{itemize}
\item Solution: buy new sets of scriptures to mark; don't always read
from a marked set but read from a clean set or an electronic version.
\item {\it Thought, 2013.04.10:} This is a bit of an excuse.  Studying the
scriptures and being attentive will solve a lot of this problem.
\end{itemize}
\item When working with one set, once a section has a lot of marking to it, I
can't mark anything else without diminishing the value of the markings there
\begin{itemize}
\item Solution: get a new set to mark, and keep all old sets for
reference
\end{itemize}
\item It is not a solution for containing all of my notes on a passage.  There
is not enough room to do that justice.
\begin{itemize}
\item Solution: keep more comprehensive notes in another place (I prefer
document files)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Electronic vs. Print}

Thoughts, 2010.11.15:
I think it is not a simple discussion of saying one should be used universally
over the other.  There are different contexts in which scriptures and notes are
used:
Personal study,
At home,
On the go,
Public use,
Sacrament meeting,
Sunday school,
Priesthood,
Institute,
Firesides.

So I see advantages and disadvantages to each thing

\begin{tabular}{c | c}
 Electronic Devices & Traditional Printed Books\\
\hline
portable & sunday school flipping \\
organizable and changeable & Notes are faster to take \\
Avoid the downsides of marking  & visual marks\\
 quicker list of notes to each passage &
more personal \\
& easier to teach from \\
& colored footnotes \\
\end{tabular}


\subsection{Deep Doctrines}

Note, Church, 2010.11.14:
A lot of times deep doctrine consists of things that we simply don't have
sufficient information about.

\subsection{Pondering}

Note, Church, 2010.11.14:
There is wisdom in letting ideas simmer more than I have been accustomed to
doing.

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Note, Church, 2010.11.14:
There is wisdom in slowing down.  I shouldn't feel weird about not covering a
lot of ground as long as I am learning a lot, especially in my personal study.

\subsection{Personal Experiences}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Scriptures I have memorized have encouraged me to be better (Moro. 7:45,
Ether 12:6)
 \item Scriptures I have studied intensely have encouraged me to be better
(Matt. 5)
 \item My scripture study study: I studied long and hard about how to do
scripture
study better.
\end{itemize}

There are very few exceptions to leaving the house without studying the
scriptures.

\subsection{What the scriptures are not:}

Note, 2011.05.20
\begin{itemize}
\item They are not just for scattering quotes through talks.
\item They are not only for those with leadership callings.
\item They are not only for those called to teach gospel doctrine.
\item They are not only for a quick fix.
\item They are not boring.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparing it to studying math}

Thought 11.27.12: In math, I see that one needs to figure things out for
oneself.  In scripture study, does the same hold?  Of the top of my head, I can
say that I don't currently feel the need to go through things quickly, so I
don't really lose anything by going slowly and figuring things out.

\subsection{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
 \item I have experiences with people who studied extra hours on their
missions, yet
their knowledge wasn't as good as I would expect. What is the formula to
building a strong understanding of the gospel, if not hours of study. (In these
cases, the people were faithful. Is the prideful point of view that some people
simply are smarter than others the correct one in this case?)
\begin{itemize}
 \item 	Thought (2010.10.27): I have come upon ideas toward answering this
question
\begin{itemize}
 \item There are ways of studying ``smarter'' not ``harder''.  These
don't have to do with natural intelligence per se and can be learned.  In some
ways these are the same as techniques which help one to succeed at school.
		\item On the other hand, gospel study is distinctly different
from
school in that one has his own agenda.  What one studies and for what purpose is
up to the individual.  Could it be that this contributes to this learning gap?
How does a lack of good study goals hinder one's progress?
\end{itemize}
\item Thought (2012.10.09):
\begin{itemize}
 \item The main people I think of with this issue are righteous people who have
blessings in their lives.  I cannot rule out those people having received their
reward for their extra scripture study.
 \item My current view is that yes, some people are just smarter.
I have been very blessed with not needing to put forth a lot of effort to learn.
\end{itemize}
\item	Sub-question: How do I gain more gospel knowledge?
\begin{itemize}
\item (From mission journal) Intensify prayer, ask questions, see
pieces of the puzzle which I don't quite understand.
	\item 	Thought (2009.10.20): We are taught to ``search, ponder, and
pray''. I learned in institute that many of the revelations in the D\&C came
after pondering the scriptures. It was also commented that it is better to study
for a set period of time than to force oneself to finish a block of
reading---one
can ponder a single verse for an hour and gain more from one's study than by
reading without pondering.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Second Coming}

Someone speculated that the Second Coming is gradual. That sounds dubious to me.

\section{Service}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Mosiah 2:17
 \item Mosiah 18:8-10
 \item James 1:26-27
\end{itemize}

\noindent Pres. Thomas S. Monson, ``Great Expectations'', CES Fireside Jan 11,
2009
\begin{quote}
 ``An attitude of love characterized the mission of the Master. He
gave sight to the blind, legs to the lame, and life to the dead. Perhaps when we
make face-to-face contact with our Maker, we will not be asked, ``How many
positions did you hold?'' but rather, ``How many people did you help?'' In
reality,
you can never love the Lord until you serve Him by serving His people.''
\end{quote}

\noindent Note, Church 2010.09.13:
We spend so much time on ourselves.  In doing service, we need to shift our
focus onto others.

\section{Simplicity}

The Things of God Are Simple
\begin{itemize}
 \item Isa 58:8-9
 \item Alma 37:6-7
 \item 2 Ne. 26:23-24, 33
 \item 2 Ne. 9:28-29
 \item The iron rod vs. the chains of Hell
\end{itemize}


\section{Teaching}

Note, Church, 2010.10.18

How does gospel teaching relate to my math teaching.
As a math teacher, I am sure to review the fundamentals.

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Note, Church, 2010.10.18

I notice that sometimes we have the phrase, ``don't give the primary answers.''
 I
am now thinking that this is a bad attitude.
The primary answers are the most important things.  When given great focus and
attention, they will yield amazing results.
When we have this attitude, we have the attitude of looking to ``good'' things
or
``better'' things instead of the ``best'' things.

\subsection{Teaching With Questions}

Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, p.74
\begin{quote}
It is important for a teacher to make sure that the students understand there is
only one stupid question, and that is the one that is never asked.
\end{quote}
What Is the Purpose of Question Asking?

Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, p.65

\begin{quote}
The simplest way to learn something is to ask a question about it.
\end{quote}

Preach My Gospel, p.183
\begin{quote}
Good questions will help you understand interests, concerns, or questions that
others have.  They can enhance your teaching, invite the spirit, and help your
investigators learn.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Scriptural Examples}

Teaching, No Greater Call, p. 68
\begin{quote}
Jesus Christ, the Master Teacher, often asked questions to encourage people to
ponder and apply the principles He taught (see, for example, Matthew 16:13-15;
Luke 7:41-42; 3 Nephi 27:27). His questions prompted thought, soul-searching,
and commitment.
\end{quote}

Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, p.65
\begin{quote}
In all training and teaching and classroom situations we find the question. This
was true of Jesus as He taught His disciples or the multitudes. There is
something interesting and meaningful about the way He handled questions and
answers. He asked many questions. He answered but a few of them.
\end{quote}

\textbf{The Spirit of the Lord to Nephi}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Behold, what desirest thou? (1 Nephi 11:2.)
 \item Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken? (1
Nephi 11:4.)
 \item What desirest thou? (1 Nephi 11:10.)
 \item Knowest thou the condescension of God? (1 Nephi 11:16.)
 \item Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw? (1 Nephi
11:21.)
 \item Thou rememberest the twelve apostles of the Lamb? (1 Nephi 12:9.)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{What to Do and What not to Do}

From Teaching, No Greater Call p. 68

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ask questions that learners can answer
 \item Respond to incorrect answers with respect and courtesy
 \item Wait for responses
 \item Use follow-up questions
 \item Give everyone an opportunity to speak
 \item Help learners prepare to answer questions
 \item Avoid questions that create controversy or encourage argument
 \item Occasionally ask questions that prompt silent reflection
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

Preach My Gospel, p. 183-184
\begin{quote}
 Try to ask questions that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Are simple and easy to understand.
 \item Help people think about what you are teaching.
 \item Help you determine how well the investigator understands what you are
teaching.
 \item Help people apply what they learn.
\end{itemize}

$\ldots$Avoid asking questions that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Include more than one idea.
 \item  Pertain to doctrines you have not taught yet.
 \item Do not have a clear purpose.
 \item Interrogate and pry unnecessarily.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

Teaching, No Greater Call p. 68
\begin{quote}
When asking [questions that prompt deeper thinking], be open to all answers (see
``Listening,'' pages 66-67). Encourage learners to ponder the scriptures and
gospel principles being discussed and to express their ideas. Do not try to get
them to give specific answers to questions; they will quickly become aware of
what you are doing and either stop participating or start guessing instead of
thinking. When you need a specific answer, it is best to ask a factual question
or present the information in some other way.
\end{quote}

Thought, Study, 2010.11.17
\begin{quote}
I notice that with the ``guess what I am thinking'' method, sometimes teachers
using this method rely on the students giving the correct answer to segue to
their next point.
\end{quote}

Thoughts on Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, p.72-74
\begin{quote}
He talks about asking good questions and how it will help the class participate.
 He gives three examples of questions:

``Would you give me the year, the month, the day, and the time of day that the
Prophet Joseph Smith was martyred in Carthage Jail?''

``A much better question would be, "In reviewing Church history, let me remind
you that it was in the afternoon of June 27, 1844, that the Prophet Joseph Smith
was killed. We know about what time it was because the watch that John Taylor
wore was struck by a bullet and stopped at that hour. Tell me, please, why was
Joseph Smith willing to go to Carthage when he knew what would probably take
place?"

"In your opinion, why did Joseph Smith go to Carthage when he knew he would be
in danger?"

These questions are in ascending order of effectiveness.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{What Happens When Poor Questions Are Asked}

Preach My Gospel, p.183
\begin{quote}
Poor questions can intimidate, irritate, and offend investigators.  They can
also cause you to lose control of the teaching situation.
\end{quote}

Thoughts on Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, p.72-74
\begin{quote}
He says that poor question asking causes the students to participate less, if at
all.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Types of Questions}

\textit{From Teaching, No Greater Call p. 68}

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent \textit{Questions that can be answered yes or no}
\begin{quote}
``Questions that can be answered yes or no have limited use in gospel
instruction. You should use them primarily to obtain commitments or to determine
if someone agrees or disagrees.''
\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Factual questions}
\begin{quote}
``Make sure that you do not ask only factual questions. They do not require much
thought, and they may discourage those who do not know the answers. When you do
use them, you should generally make sure that the information necessary to
answer them is available to those you teach.''

	``With factual questions, you can help everyone begin a discussion at
the
same point. You can then move to questions that prompt deeper thinking and help
learners see how gospel principles apply in their lives.''
\end{quote}

\noindent \textit{Questions that prompt deeper thinking}
\begin{quote}
``These questions often begin with the words what, how, or why. They cannot be
answered with yes or no, and they usually have more than one right answer.''
Questions that help learners apply gospel principles

``Ask learners to share examples of how they or others have applied the gospel
principles being discussed. As prompted by the Spirit, encourage them to bear
testimony of the principles they discuss.''
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Answering a Question with a Question}

Boyd K. Packer, Teach Ye Diligently, p.66
\begin{quote}
Contrary to what you may suppose, the Lord generally did not answer
questions--at least not in the usual way, particularly the questions that came
from those who were tempting Him. Generally He did not answer them with a direct
answer or an explanation. In fact, He almost always responded by asking a
question of those who raised the question in the first place.
Creative Uses of Questions
\end{quote}

Teaching, No Greater Call p. 68
\begin{quote}
You may want to use questions in some of the following ways:

Write questions on wordstrips, and tape the wordstrips to the bottoms of chairs.
At appropriate times during the discussion, ask each person to remove the
question from his or her chair. Then have him or her read the question and
respond to it.

Ask each learner to write one question based on a gospel principle or verse of
scripture. Gather the questions and discuss them.

Ask individuals to role-play characters of their choice in the lesson, and let
the others ask them questions (see ``Role Playing,'' page 178). This works
particularly well with children.

During the week before the lesson, give questions to a few learners. Ask them to
prepare to respond to those questions as part of the coming lesson.

Use the following questions to discuss a gospel principle: ``What do we already
know about this principle?'' ``What do we want to know?'' ``What have we learned
today?'' You can form the basis of the lesson by having learners answer these
questions and then writing their answers in three columns on the chalkboard.
Write a question on the chalkboard before class begins so that learners can
begin pondering it as soon as they arrive.

Have learners answer questions by finding and reading appropriate scriptures or
hymns. Ask learners to respond to questions by sharing examples from their own
lives.

Divide the class into small groups. Give each group a few questions to consider.
Then have each group report their answers to the class.

\noindent Boyd K. Packer, ``The Cloven Tongues of Fire,'' Ensign, May 2000, 7
\begin{quote}
The parable: A merchant man seeking precious jewels found at last the perfect
pearl. He had the finest craftsman carve a superb jewel box and line it with
blue velvet. He put his pearl of great price on display so others could share
his treasure. He watched as people came to see it. Soon he turned away in
sorrow. It was the box they admired, not the pearl.
\end{quote}

\noindent Note 2010.08.01 (church):
At the temple we receive instructions and make covenants.  All instructions are
immediately followed by covenants.

\vspace{1 em}

\noindent Note, Church 2010.09.05:
We can take a small block of spare time to go to the temple.  We may not have
time for a whole endowment session, in which case we are more than welcome to do
initiatories or something of the sort.

	When we start our families, we can also, as a couple, take turns going
to the temple, so that we don't have to get a babysitter.

\subsection{Temple in Ancient Times}

James E. Talmage, "A History of Temples", Ensign, Oct. 2010, 52-59
\begin{quote}
The Latin templum was the equivalent of the Hebrew beth Elohim and signified the
abode of Deity; hence it meant literally the house of the Lord.

While the outer courts of such temples were used as places of general assembly
and public ceremony, there were always inner precincts into which only the
consecrated priests might enter and wherein, it was claimed, the presence of the
deity was manifest.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Latter-Day Temples}

Old Testament Institute Manual, (13-19)
\begin{quote}
``[The world] room depicts the world in which we live and die. Here instruction
is given regarding man's second estate and the manner in which he may overcome
the obstacles of mortality.

``The terrestrial room is symbolic of the peace that may be attained by men as
they overcome their fallen condition through obedience to the laws and
ordinances of the gospel.

``The celestial room symbolizes the eternal joy and peace found in the presence
of God. Something of the spirit of God's infinite promises to the obedient has
been captured in the design of this beautiful room.'' (Narrative for The House
of
the Lord: Filmstrip Script, frames 43, 48, 51.)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Moses' Temple}


\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{moses_temple.jpeg}
\end{center}


\noindent Old Testament Institute Manual, (13-19)
\begin{quote}
	There are three major divisions or areas in the tabernacle: the outer
courtyard; the first room of the tabernacle proper, or holy place; and the inner
room, or Holy of Holies. In modern temples three levels of life are also
depicted by rooms in the temple: the world, or telestial, room; the terrestrial
room; and the celestial room.
\end{quote}

Notes based on Old Testament Institute Manual, (13-19)

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The outer courtyard (the world or telestial room)
\begin{itemize}
 \item 	Altar of sacrifice: the first step in the gospel is strict obedience
and sacrifice; this can be likened to having faith in Christ (looking to the
Great and Last Sacrifice) and repentance. The sacrificial fires of the great
altar signified that ``spiritual purification would come by the Holy Ghost, whom
the Father would send because of the Son'' (McConkie, The Promised Messiah, p.
431).
	\item  Laver: In Solomon's temple the laver was placed on the backs of
twelve
oxen.  This simbolism is related to baptism.
\end{itemize}
\item The holy place (the terrestrial room)
\begin{itemize}
 \item Table of shewbread: Sacrament; simbolized the body and blood of
Christ.
 \item  Candlestick, or lampstand:
with its seven branches and its olive oil symbolized the perfect light of the
Spirit (see D\&C 45:56-57 ) through which the spiritually reborn person sees all
truth (see John 14:16-17 ; 15:26 ).
 \item Altar of incense: a symbol of prayer; directly in front of the veil;
that the incense was consumed on coals of fire would suggest that even our
prayers should be directed and influenced by the Holy Ghost (see 3 Nephi 19:24 ;
Romans 8:26 ).
\end{itemize}
\item The Holy of Holies (the celestial room)
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ark of the covenant:
the Lord Himself said this was the place where He would meet Moses and commune
with the people (see Exodus 25:22 ); both on the veil, separating the holy place
from the most holy, and on the lid of the ark were cherubim, or angels; this use
of angels provides a beautiful representation of the concept taught in
latter-day scripture that one passes by the angels on his way to exaltation (see
D\&C 132:19 ).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\section{Testimony}

\subsubsection{Notes, Church, 2013.03.24}

Having a testimony and being converted are two distinct topics.

\section{Thoughts}

Keeping one's thoughts clean brings power.
Keeping one's thoughts positive brings power.

Proverbs 23:7: ``For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he$\ldots$''

\subsection{Central Topic}

Personal Insight, 2012.04.23
\begin{quote}
``Thoughts" is a central topic (like pride).  Mastery of this one thing
necessarily implies obedience to the gospel and therefore success in everything.
 Failure in this one thing implies disobedience, lack of spirituality, and
therefore failure in life.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Appropriate Media}

Pres. Thomas S. Monson, ``Great Expectations'', CES Fireside 2009.01.04
\begin{quote}
``Don't be afraid to walk out of a movie, turn off a television set, or
change the radio station if what's being presented does not meet your Heavenly
Father's standards. In short, if you have any question about whether a
particular movie, book, or other form of entertainment is appropriate, don't see
it, don't read it, don't participate.''
\end{quote}

Notes, Church, 2009.02.08
\begin{quote}
The Lord wouldn't command us to have virtuous thoughts if it were impossible.
Our mind is a stage--there is always something on it.
Thoughts are like water--they follow the path of least resistance.
Choose a favorite hymn for the hour of temptation.
``Evil cannot tolerate the presence of light''.
Charity + Virtue $\Rightarrow$ confidence in the presence of God.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Lord Never Had Unclean Thoughts}

Stephen Robinson, Believing Christ, 115
\begin{quote}
Do not misunderstand me.  I am not suggesting here that Jesus in any way
indulged in unclean thoughts, for that would be sin, and he indulged in nothing
sinful.  I do not believe that he ‘struggled' or ‘wrestled' with temptations.
My only point is that he was as vulnerable to suggestions and impulses coming
into his mind from his mortal nature, a nature inherited from his mortal mother,
as any of us.  He simply paid no attention to those suggestions, and he
immediately put them out of his mind.  The ability of the flesh to suggest, to
entice, was the same for him as it is for us, but unlike the rest of us, he
never responded to it.  He didn't ponder, deliberate, or entertain the sinful
options even as theoretical possibilities--''he gave no heed unto them.''
\end{quote}

\section{Tragedy of the Commons}

This is about individual behaviors which
\begin{enumerate}
 \item when taken by an individual individual within a group benefit that
individual, but
 \item when taken by a large number of the individuals in the group harm
everyone.
\end{enumerate}

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Poluting
 \item Not voting
 \item Population growth
 \item Stealing
 \item Spam email
 \item Using the freeways
\end{itemize}

The gospel teaches us that there are behaviors which we should adopt which fight
this phenomenon:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Giving to the poor
 \item Service
 \item Honesty
 \item Chastity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Careful!}

Ultimately, the gospel transcends this topic.
We would still follow the gospel even if it didn't do these things for us.

\section{Translated Beings}

\subsection{Transfiguration, Translation, and Resurrection}

\subsubsection{Transfiguration}

Mormon Doctrine, ``Transfiguration''
\begin{quote}
Transfiguration is a special change in appearance and nature which is wrought
upon by a person or thing by the power of God.  This divine transformation is
from a lower to a higher state; it results in a more exalted, impressive, and
glorious condition.
Prophets we translated to be able to stand in the presence of God.
Transfiguration is temporary: those who are translated return to the lower state
of mere mortality.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Translation}
Teachings, p.170-171
\begin{quote}
``[A] distinction is made between the doctrine of the actual resurrection and
translation: translation obtains deliverance from the tortures and sufferings of
the body, but their existence will prolong as to the labors and toils of the
ministry, before they can enter into so great a rest and glory.''
See 3 Ne. 28 for a description of the three Nephites state as translated beings.
These beings die and are resurrected in a twinkling of an eye. (See Mormon
Doctrine, ``Translated Beings'')
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Resurrection}
A permanent state which occurs after death. We receive a perfect body.


\subsection{Examples of Translated Beings}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Mormon Doctrine, ``Translated Beings''
\begin{quote}
	Enoch and his people were translated, probably just a few years after
Adam's death. (Moses 7:18-21, 31, 63, 69; D. \& C. 38:4; 45:11-14; 84:99-100;
Gen. 5:22-24; Heb. 11:5.)
\end{quote}
 \item TJS Gen. 14:32-34: Melchizedek and his people
 \item Alma 45:18-19: Moses
 \subitem Mormon Doctrine, ``Translated Beings''
\begin{quote}
	The Old Testament account that Moses died and was buried by the hand of
the Lord in an unknown grave is an error. (Deut. 34:5-7.) It is true that he may
have been "buried by the hand of the Lord," if that expression is a figure of
speech which means that he was translated.
\end{quote}
 \item 2 Kings 2: Elijah
 \subitem Mormon Doctrine, ``Translated Beings''
\begin{quote}
	Moses and Elijah were translated so that they could come with bodies of
flesh and bones to confer keys upon Peter, James, and John on the mount of
transfiguration, an event destined to occur prior to the beginning of the
resurrection. (Matt. 17:1-6; Teachings, p. 158; Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 2,
pp. 107-111.)
\end{quote}
 \item Alma the Younger
 \subitem Teachings, p. 170.
\begin{quote}
	Translated beings are "held in reserve to be ministering angels unto
many planets."
\end{quote}
 \item John the Revelator (John 21:20-23; Rev. 10; D. \& C. 7; 77:14.)
\item The three Nephites (3 Ne. 28)
\end{itemize}

\section{Zion}

\begin{itemize}
 \item D\&C 97:21: ``This is Zion--The Pure in Heart.''
 \item 3 Ne. 12:8: ``Blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.''
\end{itemize}

\noindent Elder D. Todd Christofferson, ``Come to Zion'', Oct. 2008 Conference
\begin{quote}
 Zion is both a place and a people. Zion was the name given to the
ancient city of Enoch in the days before the Flood. "And it came to pass in his
days, that he built a city that was called the City of Holiness, even Zion"
(Moses 7:19). This Zion endured for some 365 years (see Moses 7:68). The
scriptural record states, "And Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he
dwelt in the midst of Zion; and it came to pass that Zion was not, for God
received it up into his own bosom; and from thence went forth the saying, Zion
is fled" (Moses 7:69). Later, Jerusalem and its temple were called Mount Zion,
and the scriptures prophesy of a future New Jerusalem where Christ shall reign
as "King of Zion," when "for the space of a thousand years the earth shall rest"
(Moses 7:53, 64).

	The Lord called Enoch's people Zion "because they were of one heart and
one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them" (Moses
7:18). Elsewhere He said, "For this is Zion---the pure in heart" (D\&C 97:21).
\end{quote}


\noindent Mormon Doctrine
\begin{quote}
Zion is the name given by the Lord to his saints$\ldots$

The city of Enoch was called ``the City of Holiness, even Zion.''

The name Zion was applied to one of the hills upon which Jerusalem is built or
(later) to the entire city.

The New Jerusalem to be built in Jackson County, Missouri, is also called the
City of Zion or Zion.

Joseph Smith announced at the April, 1844, general conference of the Church that
all of North and South America comprise the Land of Zion.

At the Second Coming, ``the Lamb shall stand upon Mount Zion$\ldots$'' The Mount
Zion
spoken of is$\ldots$the New Jerusalem to be built in Jackson County, Missouri
(D\&C
84:1-4).

Paul uses the term Mount Zion to refer to the abode of exalted beings (Heb
12:22-24).
\end{quote}

JST, Gen. 14:33-35: Melchizedek was translated with his people.
Jerusalem will be the religious capital, New Jerusalem will be the legislative
capital
People will still live everywhere. Zion is people. Where there is a stake, there
Zion is by extension.

\subsection{Building Zion}

D\&C 105:5: ``And Zion cannot be built up unless it is by the principles of the
law of the celestial kingdom; otherwise I cannot receive her unto myself.''

Zion will be built during the Millenium.
