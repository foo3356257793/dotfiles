*Example*
$$
58 = 6 \times 9 + 4
$$
and
$$
4, 4 (3/2), 4 (3/2)^2
=
4,6,9
$$
$$
4 (x^2 + x + 1) = 58
$$
has roots in $\QQ$.

*Example*.

$9$ works:
$9 = 2 \times 4 + 1$

*Example*.

Here are possible forms

$$
n = a (ar) + ar^2 = (ar) (a+r)
n = a (ar^2) + ar = (ar) (ar+1)
n = (ar)(ar^2) + a = a (ar^3+1)
$$

For $9$:
$$
9 = 1 (2^3 + 1)
$$

*Denom*.

Let $r = b/c$.  Need $c^2 | a$.  Let $a = c^2k$.
We get
$$
n = (c^2 k (b/c))(c^2 k + b/c) = (bk)(c^3 k + b)
n = (bck) (bk+1)
n = (ck)(k b^3 + c)
$$

Consider the last case.  Let $n=m^2$.  We have
$$
m^2 = (ck)(k b^3 + c)
$$

**again**

a, b, c in a geometric distribution implies

$$
b = ar => r = b/a
c = ar^2 = a (b/a)^2 = b^2/a
$$

We need $a | b^2$.

*cases*.
$$
n = ab + c
n = ac + b
n = bc + a
$$
gives
$$
n = ab + b^2/a
n = ab^2/a + b = b^2 + b = b(b+1)
n = b^3/a + a
$$

The second case is always non-square.

_Pf_. Let $p | n$. Either $p|b$ or $p|b+1$.
We cannot have both.  This should imply that
$b$ and $b+1$ must both be coprime squares,
which is impossible. *QED*

The other two cases are equivalent (up to reversing
the arithmetic sequence).

Consider
$$
n = bc + a
$$
Let $\nu_p(a) = A, \nu_p(b) = B, \nu_p(C) = C$.
Then
$$
C = B + (B-A) = 2B-A \; .
$$

Then
$$
\nu_p(n) = \min\{ A, 3B-A \} \; .
$$
Note also that $2B-A \geq 0$.

$p^4 | a$, $p^2 | b$, $p^0 | c$ is the smallest case which works.

**again**

Can reduce to
$$
m^2 = (a*r)(a*r^2) + a = a^2 r^3 + a
$$
so
$$
(m^2 - a)/a^2 = r^3
$$
$$
(m/a)^2 - 1/a = r^3
$$

*Example*.

$a = 36$, $r=2$ gives
$$
(102/36)^2 - 1/36 = 8
$$

Note in this example that $102/36 = 17/sqrt(36)$.

*Note*.

$$
m^2 = a^2 r^3 + a
$$
Let $\nu_p(a) = A$, $\nu_p(r) = R$, $\nu_p(m) = M$.
We need $2A \geq 3R$.

# Again

Consider a sequence
$a, b, b^2/a$, where $a | b^2$.

Need remainder less than divisor.  Cannot have remainder be $b^2/a$,
which we will consider the max.

Consider two cases
$$
m^2 = a (b^2/a) + b
m^2 = b (b^2/a) + a
$$

In the first case,
$$
m^2 = b^2 + b = b(b+1)
$$
which cannot be a square.

In the second case
$$
m^2 = b^3/a + a
$$

If $p|a$, then need $p|b$ and we get
$$
m^2 = a mod p^2
$$
Hence need $p^2 | a$.

*Example*.
$$
9 = 2 \times 4 + 1
$$
$$
144 \times 72 = 36
$$
The remainders here are, in fact, square.

*Special case*.

$$
m^2 = b^3/A^2 + A^2
(m-A)(m+A) = b^3/A^2
$$

$$
(102-36)(102+36)
$$

## Again

$$
m^2 = b^3/a + a
$$

If we have $b \leq m$, then $b$ is bounded by $10^{6}$.
We then need
$$
b^3/a + a \leq 10^{6}
$$

*approach*.

$$
a
ar
ar^2
$$
Let $r=p/q > 1$.

Need $ap^2/q^2$ integral, so $a\gets aq^2$.
Then
$$
aq^2
apq
ap^2
$$
This gives
$$
m^2 = a^2 p^3 q + aq^2
$$
This gives $p \leq 10^4$.
Also have $q \leq p$.
