Let $a,b,c$ be sides of a triangle,
and $p,q,r$ the lengths.  If these are all
integers, this is a Torricelli triangle.

Need the angles less than $120$ degrees.

The suggested solution is that you you can draw
the diagram of equilateral triangles and get things
to intersect.

# Example

$$
a = 399
b = 455
c = 511
$$
has $p+q+r = 784$.

Place one side on the $x$ axis.  What are the coordinates?


$(0,0), (a,0), (x,y)$
where
$$
x^2+y^2 = c^2
(x-a)^2 + y^2 = b^2
$$

What are the coordinates of the $T$ point?
If $(s,t)=T$, then
$$
p^2 = s^2+t^2
q^2 = (a-s)^2 + t^2
r^2 = (x-s)^2 + (t-y)^2
$$

## Wikipedia

We can use Lagrange multipliers for this.

We have a triangle with sides $a,b,c$.

Look at the triangle with sides $a,q,r$.  We have
$$
a^2 = q^2 + r^2 - 2qr \cos \gamma
$$

For all three
$$
a^2 = q^2 + r^2 - 2qr \cos \gamma_a
b^2 = p^2 + q^2 - 2qr \cos \gamma_b
c^2 = r^2 + p^2 - 2qr \cos \gamma_c
$$
where
$$
\gamma_a + \gamma_b + \gamma_c = 2\pi
$$
We want to first solve for $p^2,q^2,r^2$
