\subsection*{Linda George}

I would prefer a daytime schedule.  And a fire lit under my rear
end ;)

\subsection*{Debbie Keuhn}:

RS Presiency, I stink at visiting teaching. I like serving others
but I am far from accomplishing one assignment. Emails would be a
potential glimmer of hope for me to complete the assignment. (Don't
hold your breath). 

I start school in a week and my husband will have surgery at the
end of my first week in school. Visiting Teachers don't work out
for me right now. Between family and school, a visit from anyone
generally doesn't work. I'd rather email for the message. 

There you have it. 

\subsection*{Denise Matheson}

Thank you for this thoughtful email.  I would like to have
different sisters to VT me b/c I haven't received any visits in a
gooooooood while.  I also would like to either visit sister Jeanine
Vest or have her visit me. She is a great person that I know I
would benefit a lot from interacting with in a monthly basis.

Everything else to me is fine.

Thank you!!!!

\subsection*{Terri Dawkins}

Hello ladies!!

While I really hate to loose the women I've been visit teaching, I
want them to be able to have all the blessings of being visit
taught on a regular basis.

Since January, I have only been able to dedicate my time to my son,
his treatments, and the rest of my family with the rest of my
time.  :-)  So, I was wondering if you have any women on a letter
route??  Maybe I could do that??

Thanks so much!!

\subsection*{McKell Jackson}

Hello! Visiting Teaching is so needed when you're in primary! I
love getting to know the ladies I visit and serving where I can. My
current companion, Nel Horr, is having a tough time with her
husband being deployed. She doesn't feel able to go on visits at
all, so I've been going solo--sometimes. (Truthfully, I have some
social anxiety and going without a companion for back up is
difficult for me.) I want to be successful at this, and crave the
connection and friendship that stems from VT. I want to make sure
Nel has the support she needs as well. So, I'm not really sure what
my point is, but I felt you should be aware of the situation. I
trust your inspiration. 

\subsection*{Amber Wallace}

Hello! I did want to make one request when it comes to my new
route... The ladies I've been visiting are wonderful, but they have
only been able to meet in the evenings and that gets really tricky
for me what with Young Women's and my husband's work/school
schedule. I would love to be able to visit sisters who wouldn't
mind visits during the daytime. I hope that's not too much to ask.
Thanks for all you do!

\subsection*{Jenn Richardson}

Kym Porter and I have been able to successfully complete our
assignment as is visiting Claire Roach, Janelle Savage, and Moni
Ward.  (We should probably get better at reporting though)

\subsection*{Chrissy Barnum}

I just wanted to respond regarding the Vteaching changes! I need to
make visits mainly in the evenings/weekends right now- so that I
don't have to bring all my children with me! My companion and I get
along great- I just hope she's not annoyed with my visiting
schedule since she is home during the day without kids and could
probably visit then?! 

Also- on another note- I'm still new to this whole compassionate
service calling. I have had somewhat of a hard time with feeling
like I am stepping on vteacher's toes as I lovingly suggest that
they set up meals for the sisters that they are over. I have
offered to bring a meal with each sister as well- but don't always
hear back from the companionship in a timely manner on this.I just
want to make sure I am going about this right as well-- the way I
understand it the visiting teachers should be setting up meals for
these sisters?  OR am I the one who should be coordinating that-
because that's kind of what I have been doing?? Megan Fewkes just
messaged me today that they could use a meal when she comes home
tomorrow and said she hadn't heard from her vteachers. So- I will
most likely be taking that- which I don't mind- I am just wondering
if the vteachers should be first on scene?!  Thanks for your
guidance!!! Have a great night!

\subsection*{Elke Martinez}

I love visiting Sister Horr.  My partner Sis Butzen is pretty much
not wanting to go to church anymore.  She won’t respond to any
effort to get a hold of her.  I think Sister Snook is the only
sister she talked with.  I would like to visit ladies on post
only.  I don’t really want visiting teachers so you can use them
where they are needed more.
