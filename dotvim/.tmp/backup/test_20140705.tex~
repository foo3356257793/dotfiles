\title{Chapter 7: ``Pure Religion'': Watchcare and Ministering through Visiting Teaching}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

When Jesus Christ was on the earth, He showed us the way we should
live. “He marked the path and led the way,” Sister Eliza R. Snow
wrote.1 He showed us how to minister—how to watch over and
strengthen one another. His was a ministry to individuals, one by
one. He taught that we should leave the ninety and nine to save the
straying one.2 He healed and taught individuals, even spending time
with each person in a multitude of 2,500 people, allowing each to
receive a personal witness of His divinity.3

The Savior calls His disciples to work with Him in His ministry,
giving them the opportunity to serve others and become more like
Him. In Relief Society, each sister has the opportunity to watch
over and strengthen sisters one by one through visiting teaching.
Sister Julie B. Beck, the fifteenth Relief Society general
president, said, “Because we follow the example and teachings of
Jesus Christ, we value this sacred assignment to love, know, serve,
understand, teach, and minister in His behalf.”4

Beginnings of Visiting Teaching: Collecting Donations and Organizing
Service

“Let us have compassion upon each other, and let the strong tenderly
nurse the weak into strength, and let those who can see guide the
blind until they can see the way for themselves.”
Brigham Young
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Brigham Young (1997), 219
In 1843, as the population of Nauvoo, Illinois, expanded, the
Latter-day Saints in the city were divided into four wards. In a
meeting held on July 28 of that year, Relief Society leaders
appointed a visiting committee of four sisters for each ward. The
visiting committees’ most visible responsibilities were to assess
needs and collect donations.

Donations included money, food, and clothing. Each week, visiting
committees gave the donations they had collected to the treasurer of
the Relief Society. The Relief Society used these donations to
provide aid and relief for the needy.

In fulfilling this responsibility, one sister expressed her belief
that “our salvation depend[s] on our liberality to the poor.”
Another sister expressed her agreement, saying: “The Lord confirms
it again and again. He is delighted with our acts of charity.”5

This practice continued well into the twentieth century. Generally
the sisters who were assigned to go visiting went with baskets in
hand, receiving items such as matches, rice, baking soda, and
bottles of fruit. Most donations were used to help with local needs,
but some were used to meet needs thousands of miles away. For
example, after World War II, Relief Society sisters in the United
States gathered, sorted, mended, and packed more than 500,000
articles of clothing and sent them to Europe.

In addition to collecting donations, visiting committees assessed
the needs in the homes they visited. They reported their
observations to Relief Society leaders, who organized efforts to
help.

Visiting committees collected donations to help with local needs.

President Joseph F. Smith, the sixth President of the Church, told
of a time when he saw Relief Society sisters extend unselfish,
Christlike love to a family:

“It was my privilege not long ago to visit one of our settlements in
an outlying Stake of Zion where a great deal of sickness prevailed
at the time, and although we had been traveling many days and we
reached the settlement late in the evening, we were solicited to go
round with the president to visit some of the sick. We found a poor
sister prostrate upon a bed of sickness, in a very critical
condition. Her poor husband sat by her bedside almost distracted at
the dreadful illness of his wife who was the mother of a number of
little children clustered around. The family seemed to be in a very
destitute condition.

“A nice matronly woman soon came into the house, carrying with her a
basket containing nourishing food and some delicacies for the use of
the afflicted family. On inquiry we learned that she had been
detailed by the Relief Society of the ward to watch over and
administer to the sick woman through the night. She was there
prepared to look after the little children, to see that they were
properly washed and fed and put to bed; to tidy up the house and
make everything as comfortable as possible for the afflicted woman
and her family. We also learned that another good sister would be
detailed to relieve her the following day; and so on, from day to
day, this poor, afflicted family received the kindest care and
attention from the sisters of the Relief Society until health should
again come to relieve the sick one from her sufferings.

“We also learned that this Relief Society was so organized and
disciplined that all the sick in the settlement were receiving
similar attention and ministrations for their comfort and relief.
Never before had I seen so clearly exemplified the utility and
beauty of this grand organization as in the example we here
witnessed, and I thought what a gracious thing it was that the Lord
inspired the Prophet Joseph Smith to establish such an organization
in the Church.”6

Visiting Teaching as a Spiritual Ministry

While visiting teachers have always looked after the temporal needs
of individuals and families, they have also had a higher purpose.
Sister Eliza R. Snow, the second Relief Society general president,
taught: “I consider the office of a teacher a high and holy office.
I hope the sisters do not think that it consists merely in begging
for the poor. You want to be filled with the Spirit of God, of
wisdom, of humility, of love, that in case they have nothing to give
they may not dread your coming.”

Sister Snow hoped that sisters would “perceive a difference in their
houses” after a visit.7 She counseled visiting teachers to prepare
themselves spiritually before they visited homes so they would be
able to ascertain and meet spiritual needs as well as temporal ones:
“A teacher … should surely have so much of the Spirit of the Lord,
as she enters a house to know what spirit she meets in there. …
Plead before God and the Holy Ghost to get [the Spirit] so that you
will be able to meet that spirit that prevails in that house … and
you may feel to talk words of peace and comfort, and if you find a
sister feeling cold, take her to your heart as you would a child to
your bosom and warm [her] up.”8

Sarah M. Kimball

Sarah M. Kimball, who served as a ward Relief Society president in
the late 1860s, shared similar counsel with the sisters in her ward:
“It is the duty of teachers to visit their [assigned sisters] once a
month, to inquire after the prosperity and happiness of the members.
It is their duty to speak words of wisdom, of consolation and
peace.”9 Relief Society leaders emphasized that visiting teachers
were “not only to gather means but to teach and expound the
principles of the gospel.”10 In 1916, visiting teachers were
formally asked to discuss a gospel topic each month as well as
providing temporal service. In 1923, the general Relief Society
presidency introduced uniform monthly messages to be given by all
visiting teachers.

“The Rebirth of Visiting Teaching”—“A Beautiful Experience for
Women”

Visiting teachers have always strived to meet the spiritual and
temporal needs of those they visit.
In 1944, eight years after the implementation of the Church’s
welfare plan (see chapter 5), Sister Amy Brown Lyman, the eighth
Relief Society general president, began to question visiting
teachers’ traditional responsibility to collect donations. After
studying the issue, she and her counselors recommended to the
Presiding Bishopric that “the matter of collection of funds … should
be decided by the General Authorities of the Church rather than by
the Relief Society.”

Presiding Bishop LeGrand Richards took the recommendation to the
First Presidency. He later reported that the First Presidency and
the Bishopric felt that it was “advisable for the Relief Society to
discontinue the collections of charity funds by the visiting
teachers.”11

Sister Belle S. Spafford, who was serving as Sister Lyman’s second
counselor at the time, shared a personal account of this change in
visiting teaching:

“The Brethren said, ‘No more collection of charity funds by the
Relief Society visiting teacher. You will become a service
organization, not a financing organization of charity relief.’

“… I very well recall sitting one day in a meeting with members of
the Relief Society presidency and the secretary and two or three of
the board members, when one of the sisters said, ‘They have sounded
the death knell of visiting teaching. If they can’t go to collect
for the poor, who’s going to want to go from door to door just to
visit?’ … I spoke up and I said, ‘I don’t believe it’s the death
knell. I believe it’s the rebirth of visiting teaching. And I
believe that countless women who have refused to serve as visiting
teachers will now be glad to go when they go as friendly visitors to
observe conditions in the home where there is need without making a
social welfare investigation; when they don’t have to feel like
they’re begging for money. They will know they go to build the
spirit of the home. And it will be a beautiful experience for women
who need it. … I don’t think for one minute that this is the death
knell of visiting teaching.’

“It did not prove to be. From then on the program began to flourish
and women who had not served before asked to be visiting
teachers.”12

Sister Spafford later served as the ninth Relief Society general
president. She saw countless examples of the good that visiting
teaching can bring into the lives of all Relief Society sisters. She
testified:

“Some of the very fine work is done by our visiting teachers and our
Relief Society presidents, because they go under the spirit of their
calling and they are emissaries of Relief Society. … They are
mothers, and they have the human understanding of other women and
their sorrows. So we must not narrow our concept of the social
welfare to the hungry or the poor. The Savior told us to remember
the poor in spirit, didn’t he? And don’t the rich get sick, the same
as the poor; and don’t they have a hard time to find a nurse? … Now
that’s what Relief Society is supposed to be doing. I could tell you
story after story after story where visiting teachers have done
skilled work in alleviating trouble in a home, simply in the office
of their calling.”13

A Privilege, a Duty, and a Commitment: Sharing the Vision of
Visiting Teaching Worldwide

President Henry B. Eyring, a counselor in the First Presidency,
testified that visiting teaching is part of the Lord’s plan to
provide help for people all over the world:

“The only system which could provide succor and comfort across a
church so large in a world so varied would be through individual
servants near the people in need. The Lord had seen that coming from
the beginning of Relief Society.

“He set a pattern in place. Two Relief Society sisters accept their
assignment to visit another as a call from the Lord. That was true
from the start. …

“The members of Relief Society have always been trusted by local
priesthood shepherds. Every bishop and every branch president has a
Relief Society president to depend upon. She has visiting teachers,
who know the trials and the needs of every sister. She can, through
them, know the hearts of individuals and families. She can meet
needs and help the bishop in his call to nurture individuals and
families.”14

As President Eyring observed, visiting teaching is well suited to
the worldwide growth of the Church. Through this system of
watchcare, each Latter-day Saint woman has the opportunity to be an
instrument in the Lord’s hands.

Sister Bangerter and Brazilian sisters
Sister Geraldine Bangerter, bottom left, with Brazilian sisters who
helped establish Relief Society in their homeland
Relief Society sisters have worked diligently to establish visiting
teaching throughout the world. For example, when the Church was
young in Brazil, most branches did not have Relief Societies or
knowledge about how to establish them. Because local leaders were
unfamiliar with Relief Society, William Grant Bangerter, the mission
president at the time, called his wife, Geraldine Bangerter, to be
the mission Relief Society president. She was unfamiliar with the
country, she had not yet gained proficiency with the language, and
she had just given birth to their seventh child. Nevertheless, she
started working with counselors and a secretary. With help from
sister missionaries who acted as interpreters, these sisters decided
that “the first thing they needed to do was teach the women how to
visit each other and learn about their needs. So they said, ‘We’re
going to teach about visiting teaching.’ …

“They decided to start with a little branch [in] S\~{a}o Paulo in the
industrial part of the city, whose inhabitants were mainly poor. The
presidency sent word ahead to the few sisters of that branch,
saying, ‘Please meet us on this night at this time in the building
that we rent.’”

Sister Bangerter and one of her counselors “drove across a city of
twelve million people. They showed up at the branch, where … there
were seven humble women.”

After the sisters began the meeting with a song and a prayer, one of
Sister Bangerter’s counselors stood to teach about visiting
teaching. “She held a little paper; she trembled so much it was
shaking. She got up and read her message. It lasted five minutes.

“She sat down, and they all turned to look at [Sister Bangerter],
who said, ‘I don’t speak Portuguese.’ But they wanted her to be
their teacher. No one in the room spoke English. She stood up and
said all the Portuguese she knew. It came out as a four-sentence
paragraph:

“‘Eu sei que Deus vive.’ I know that God lives.

“‘Eu sei que Jesus \'{e} o Cristo.’ I know that Jesus is the Christ.

“‘Eu sei que esta \'{e} a igreja verdadeira.’ I know this is the true
church.

“‘Em nome de Jesus Cristo, am\'{e}m.’ In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

“That was the first Relief Society meeting held in that branch—a
five-minute talk on visiting teaching from a sister who’d never had
a visiting teacher, seen a visiting teacher, or been a visiting
teacher, [followed by] a testimony of the gospel.

“… Out of that little group and others like them has grown a
wonderful, vibrant, faith-filled body of women in the country of
Brazil. They’re talented, educated, intelligent, fabulous leaders,
and they would never be what they are without the gospel of Jesus
Christ and their faith.”15

Visiting teaching has become a vehicle for Latter-day Saint women
worldwide to love, nurture, and serve—to “act according to those
sympathies which God has planted in your bosoms,” as Joseph Smith
taught.16

Dedicated visiting teachers answer the call from latter-day prophets
to give Christlike service. President Spencer W. Kimball, the
twelfth President of the Church, taught: “God does notice us, and he
watches over us. But it is usually through another person that he
meets our needs. Therefore, it is vital that we serve each other in
the kingdom.”17 President Thomas S. Monson, the sixteenth President
of the Church, said: “We are surrounded by those in need of our
attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our
kindness. … We are the Lord’s hands here upon the earth, with the
mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each
of us.”18

Visiting Teaching Today: A Continuing Effort to Follow Jesus Christ

The story of visiting teaching continues in the lives of sisters
everywhere, as Latter-day Saint women fulfill their covenant to
follow Jesus Christ. President Dieter F. Uchtdorf, a counselor in
the First Presidency, said: “You wonderful sisters render
compassionate service to others for reasons that supersede desires
for personal benefits. In this you emulate the Savior, who, though a
king, did not seek position, nor was He concerned about whether
others noticed Him. He did not bother to compete with others. His
thoughts were always tuned to help others. He taught, healed,
conversed [with], and listened to others. He knew that greatness had
little to do with outward signs of prosperity or position. He taught
and lived by this doctrine: ‘He that is greatest among you shall be
your servant.’”19

Through the years, sisters have learned that visiting teaching
requires commitment, dedication, and sacrifice. They have learned
that they need the Spirit to direct their visits. They have seen the
power that comes through teaching truth and bearing testimony,
giving temporal help with love, and being willing to mourn with,
comfort, and help bear the burdens of their sisters.

Commitment, Dedication, and Sacrifice

“Who, even in the wildest stretch of imagination, can fathom the
uncountable acts of charity that have been performed, the food that
has been put on barren tables, the faith that has been nurtured in
desperate hours of illness, the wounds that have been bound up, the
pains that have been ameliorated by loving hands and quiet and
reassuring words, the comfort that has been extended in times of
death and consequent loneliness?”
Gordon B. Hinckley
Ensign, Mar. 1992, 4
President Kimball emphasized that visiting teachers need complete
commitment and dedication. He said: “Your duties in many ways must
be much like those of the [home] teachers, which briefly are ‘to
watch over the church always’—not twenty minutes a month but
always—‘and be with and strengthen them’—not a knock at the door,
but to be with them, and lift them, and strengthen them, and empower
them, and fortify them—’and see that there is no iniquity, … neither
hardness, … backbiting, nor evil speaking.’”20 President Kimball saw
such dedication in his wife, Camilla, who said the following about
her efforts as a visiting teacher: “I have tried not to suppress any
inclination to generous word or deed.”21

Visiting teaching is an ongoing assignment; it is never really
completed. Visiting teachers often are required to sacrifice and
rise above discouragement. This is especially true when their
efforts seem to be going nowhere, as in the story of Cathie
Humphrey:

“When I was first called to be a visiting teacher, I was assigned a
young woman who never came to church. … I faithfully went every
month and knocked on her door. She would open the inside door but
leave the screen door shut. … She would not say anything. She would
just stand there. I would look cheerful and say, ‘Hi, I’m Cathie,
your visiting teacher.’ And as she would say nothing, I would say,
‘Well, our lesson today is on …’ and try briefly to say something
uplifting and friendly. When I was through, she would say, ‘Thank
you,’ and shut the door.

“I did not like going there. … But I went because I wanted to be
obedient. After about seven or eight months of this, I got a phone
call from the bishop.

“‘Cathie,’ he said, ‘the young woman you visit teach just had a baby
who lived only a few days. She and her husband are going to have a
graveside service, and she asked me to see if you would come and be
there with her. She said you are her only friend.’ I went to the
cemetery. The young woman, her husband, the bishop, and I were at
the graveside. That was all.

“I had seen her only once a month for a few minutes at a time. I
hadn’t even been able to tell through the screen door that she was
expecting a baby, yet even my inept but hopeful visiting had blessed
us both.”22

The Influence of Righteous Women
Visiting teachers and those they serve can strengthen and uplift one
another.

Seeking Spiritual Guidance

Time after time, faithful visiting teachers have sought and received
spiritual guidance. A Relief Society sister in Brazil told of a time
when she received the Lord’s help:

“I have no way to reach the sisters by phone. We don’t have
telephones. So I go to my knees in prayer to find out the sisters
that need me that week. It never fails. [For instance], we had a
dear young woman in our ward that had no clothes for her new baby. I
had no idea when she was due but I knew she was close. I got a group
of sisters together and we made some clothes for her baby. We didn’t
want her to bring that baby home in newspapers. We could not
telephone one another and so I prayed and I was told when I should
go to the hospital with this layette [baby clothes]. When I arrived
at the hospital she had just given birth to her baby and I was able
to present the clothes to her that were from her Relief Society
sisters.”23

Since each sister’s circumstances are different, visiting teachers
need specific guidance from the Holy Ghost so they can know how best
to help each one. Florence Chukwurah of Nigeria received such
guidance when she “was assigned to visit teach a sister who was
having difficulties in her marriage and in her home, making it
necessary to meet at the marketplace for a visit. After listening to
and observing this sister’s challenges, Sister Chukwurah asked her
husband for a priesthood blessing so that she might know how to help
this troubled sister. Following the blessing she felt prompted to
discuss with this sister the importance of tithing. ‘She tearfully
told me that she did not pay her tithes because she was not making
enough money,’ Sister Chukwurah remember[ed]. ‘I suggested that she
and I discuss Malachi 3:10 and that we do so in my house so we could
relax and be alone for the discussion. She consented. After our
discussion I encouraged her to exercise her faith and pay her tithes
for at least six months. I bore my testimony to her by the Spirit.’

“… Within a few months of this meeting, this sister’s circumstances
changed dramatically. Her daughter received a scholarship to
complete her high school education, her husband worked with the
bishop to become active and accept a calling, husband and wife
teamed up to improve their financial situation and their
relationship, and eventually they became an inspiration to
others.”24

Questions Visiting Teachers Can Ask

The following kinds of questions can lead to opportunities for
visiting teachers to give comfort, share relevant gospel teaching,
and provide meaningful service.
What worries or concerns do you have?
What questions do you have about the gospel or the Church?
Would you allow us to help you with \_\_\_\_\_\_?
When asking a question like this, visiting teachers should offer to
help in a specific way, such as caring for the children for a brief
time, assisting with a homemaking task, or helping to run an errand.
It is less helpful to say, “Call us if you need anything.”
Teaching Truths and Bearing Testimony

President Kimball taught that when visiting teachers share the
gospel and their testimonies, they can help their sisters follow the
Savior:

“How glorious is the privilege of two sisters going into a home. …

“There can be no force in this program as I see it. It is a matter
of encouragement and love. It is amazing how many people we can
convert with love and inspire with love. We are ‘to warn, expound,
exhort, and teach, and invite … to come unto Christ’ (D\&C 20:59), as
the Lord said in his revelations. …

“Don’t let us be satisfied with just visits, with making friends;
that, of course, has its place. … Friendship, of course, is
important, but how better can you make a friend than to teach
somebody everlasting principles of life and salvation? …

“Your testimony is a terrific medium. … You don’t always have to
bear it in the most formal manner; there are so many approaches. …

“… Visiting teachers … must excel in energy, and vision, and
thoroughness—and in testimony.”25

Visiting Teaching
As visiting teachers share truths and bear testimony, they help
others follow the Savior.

A young mother expressed her gratitude for visiting teachers who
helped her return to gospel living:

“I’m grateful to this day for my visiting teachers because they
loved me and they didn’t judge me. They really made me feel as
though I really was important and that I did have a place in the
Church.

“They’d come over to my home and we would sit and we’d visit … , and
they would leave me a message each month.

“And when they came every month, it made me feel as if I really did
matter and as though they really did care about me and as though
they really loved me and appreciated me.

“Through their visiting and coming to see us, I decided that it was
time for me to go back to church. I guess I just really didn’t know
how to come back, and by their coming and reaching out to me, they
provided a way that I could return.

“We need to realize that the Lord loves us no matter who we are, and
my visiting teachers helped me see that this was right.

“Now my husband and I have been sealed in the temple.”26

Visiting teaching is a way to bring the gospel of Jesus Christ into
the lives of sisters and their families. Sister Mary Ellen Smoot,
the thirteenth Relief Society general president, declared: “My
desire is to plead with our sisters to stop worrying about a phone
call or a quarterly or monthly visit, and whether that will do, and
concentrate instead on nurturing tender souls. Our responsibility is
to see that the gospel flame continues to burn brightly. Our charge
is to find the lost sheep and help them feel our Savior’s love.”27

Visiting teachers can receive guidance from the Holy Ghost as they
pray for help.
President Kimball taught:

“There are many sisters who are living in rags—spiritual rags. They
are entitled to gorgeous robes, spiritual robes. … It is your
privilege to go into homes and exchange robes for rags. …

“… You are going to save souls, and who can tell but that many of
the fine active people in the Church today are active because you
were in their homes and gave them a new outlook, a new vision. You
pulled back the curtain. You extended their horizons. …

“You see, you are not only saving these sisters, but perhaps also
their husbands and their homes.”28

Giving Temporal Help with Love

Charity is at the root of the temporal service and watchcare given
by visiting teachers. Often a sister and her family members have
physical needs that are difficult or impossible for them to handle
alone. This might happen when a baby is born or when illness or
death comes to a family member. Like the early Relief Society
sisters in Nauvoo and on the trek west to the Salt Lake Valley,
modern-day visiting teachers are often the first ones to help.
Sister Silvia H. Allred, a counselor in the Relief Society general
presidency, said:

“I marvel as I witness the countless acts of charity performed daily
by visiting teachers all over the world who selflessly minister to
the needs of individual sisters and their families. To these
faithful visiting teachers, I say, ‘Through those small acts of
charity, you follow the Savior and you act as instruments in His
hands as you help, care, lift, comfort, listen, encourage, nurture,
teach, and strengthen the sisters under your care.’ Let me share
[two] brief examples of such ministry.

“Rosa suffers from debilitating diabetes and other ailments. She
joined the Church a few years ago. She is a single mother with an
adolescent son. She frequently has to be hospitalized for a few days
at a time. Her kind visiting teachers not only take her to the
hospital, but they visit and comfort her at the hospital while also
watching over her son at home and school. Her visiting teachers
serve as her friends and family.

“After the first few visits to a particular sister, Kathy discovered
that this sister didn’t know how to read but wanted to learn. Kathy
offered to help her even though she knew it would take time,
patience, and constancy.”29

Mourning with Those Who Mourn, Comforting, and Helping to Bear
Burdens

“[We are] to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide for
the widow, to dry up the tear of the orphan, to comfort the
afflicted, whether in this church, or in any other, or in no church
at all, wherever [we find] them.”
Joseph Smith
Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith (2007), 426
Sister Elaine L. Jack, the twelfth Relief Society general president,
taught: “In visiting teaching we reach out to each other. Hands
often speak as voices can’t. A warm embrace conveys volumes. A laugh
together unites us. A moment of sharing refreshes our souls. We
cannot always lift the burden of one who is troubled, but we can
lift her so she can bear it well.”30

A sister who had recently been widowed was grateful for visiting
teachers who mourned with her and comforted her. She wrote: “I was
in desperate need of someone to whom I could reach out; someone who
would listen to me. … And they listened. They comforted me. They
wept with me. And they hugged me … [and] helped me out of the deep
despair and depression of those first months of loneliness.”31

Another woman summed up her feelings when she was the recipient of
true charity from a visiting teacher: “I knew that I was more than
just a number on the record books for her to visit. I knew that she
cared about me.”32

Dedicated visiting teachers practice “pure religion” (James 1:27).
How Visiting Teaching Blesses the Visiting Teacher

When sisters serve others as visiting teachers, they receive
blessings themselves. Sister Barbara W. Winder, the eleventh Relief
Society general president, taught: “It is vital that each sister
have visiting teachers—to convey a sense that she is needed, that
someone loves and thinks about her. But equally important is the way
the visiting teacher is able to grow in charity. By assigning our
women to do visiting teaching, we give them the opportunity to
develop the pure love of Christ, which can be the greatest blessing
of their lives.”33

Through visiting teaching, Relief Society sisters know they have
friends who care about them.
One sister told of blessings that were poured upon her as she served
her sisters:

“Shortly after we were married, my husband and I moved to New
Jersey. As a first-year medical student, my husband rarely returned
home before 11:30 p.m. … I hadn’t made friends quickly. This move
had been lonely and difficult for me.

“The bishop of my new ward asked me to head up a program for our
ward’s Spanish-speaking members. This meant translating in sacrament
meeting, teaching the gospel doctrine class, and overseeing the
Relief Society. Outside of the native Spanish speakers, I was the
only woman in the ward who spoke Spanish fluently.

“To add to my responsibilities, the Relief Society president gave me
a visiting teaching list of 12 sisters who lived in a barrio across
town. I’ll admit I was not thrilled about my new assignment. I was
busy with my other callings, and I was afraid that I wouldn’t know
how to reach out. … But I made some visiting teaching appointments,
and before I knew it I was sitting in the Dumez’s living room.

“‘You’re my visiting teacher?’ Sister Dumez asked as she entered the
room. ‘Welcome to my home. I haven’t had a visiting teacher in two
years.’ She listened intently to the message, we visited, and she
thanked me again and again for coming.

“Before I left she called her five children together to sing ‘I Am a
Child of God’ in Spanish. She hugged me and squeezed my hand. …

“All of the visits during that first outing went better than I had
anticipated. Throughout the following months, as the sisters
graciously welcomed me into their homes, I began to look forward to
my visits. But I was unprepared for the stories of tragedy and
adversity I heard as I got to know these beautiful people better. I
decided to at least try to make life more comfortable for these
sisters and their families, many of whom struggled financially. I
began taking casseroles when I visited. I took the families on
outings. I drove them to doctor appointments and grocery stores.

Through visiting teaching, Relief Society sisters can find joy in
serving one another.
“I quickly forgot about my own loneliness as I served others. The
sisters whom I had at first considered so different from myself soon
became my dear friends. They were loyal, steadfast friends who were
grateful for even the slightest thing I did for them. And they
anticipated my needs: I regularly received calls and gifts from the
heart. One sister crocheted a doily for my table. Another composed a
poem for my birthday.

“Yet, after several months in my callings, I was frustrated at my
inability to make life safer or more comfortable for my friends. …

“One night I felt especially discouraged. I knelt to pray, pleading
with the Lord to show me the direction to take. I felt impressed
that the Lord wanted me to help these sisters become more
self-reliant and serve each other. I’ll admit that I was skeptical
that persons carrying such tremendous burdens would have the
strength required to lift one another, but I knew I needed to follow
the prompting.

“I began by reorganizing the visiting teaching program in the
Spanish-speaking Relief Society. One of my faithful friends, Sister
Moreira, volunteered to visit six of the sisters by herself. My
first response was to protest, ‘You can’t possibly handle that route
without a car. It’s too far to walk!’ But then I remembered my
impression to let the sisters serve each other. I put all six
sisters on Sister Moreira’s new visiting teaching list.

“Upon returning from her marathon visiting teaching course, Sister
Moreira called me, filled with the Spirit. … Her feet were sore, but
the Lord had lightened her load and her heart.

“When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the
service of your God” (Mosiah 2:17).

“After a few more visits, Sister Moreira recruited another sister to
walk the route with her. …

“Once I started looking, I found all sorts of ways to help these
sisters help themselves and each other. …

“Just at the time when I could see great spiritual growth developing
among the members of my ward, I received notice that my husband and
I would be moving. … I didn’t even want to think about leaving my
wonderful friends. I yearned to continue serving with them—we had
given each other so much. But at least I could see that the cause of
the gospel was moving forth mightily in their lives, and they were
looking out for one another. I, who had set out grudgingly to labor
in the fields, had returned laden with sheaves.”34

President Lorenzo Snow, the fifth President of the Church, taught
that Relief Society sisters exemplify pure religion. He said: “The
Apostle James said that ‘pure religion and undefiled before God … is
this: To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
keep himself unspotted from the world.’ Accepting that as true, the
members of the Relief Society have most surely exemplified in their
lives pure and undefiled religion; for they have ministered to those
in affliction, they have thrown their arms of love around the
fatherless and the widows, and they have kept themselves unspotted
from the world. I can testify that there are no purer and more
God-fearing women in the world than are to be found within the ranks
of the Relief Society.”35

Pure and God-fearing sisters in the ranks of Relief Society have
watched over and strengthened one another from the beginning days in
Nauvoo to the present day, through loving and inspired visiting
teaching. It is a ministry that is shared one by one, heart to
heart.
