\section{Characters}

\subsection*{Hamlet}
The prince of Denmark, and a student at the University of
Wittenberg. At the beginning of the play, Hamlet’s father, King
Hamlet, has recently died, and his mother, Queen Gertrude, has
married the new king, Hamlet’s uncle Claudius. Hamlet is melancholy,
bitter, and cynical, full of hatred for his uncle and disgust at his
mother for marrying him. When the ghost of Hamlet’s father appears
and claims to have been murdered by Claudius, Hamlet becomes
obsessed with avenging his father’s death but keeps thinking of
reasons why he should wait before killing Claudius—then chastizes
himself for failing to act boldly. Hamlet is a character of
contradictions. He admires characters like Fortinbras and the Player
King, who behave passionately and even violently for no good reason,
but is himself thoughtful, reflective, and philosophical. At times
Hamlet is indecisive and hesitant, but at other times he is prone to
rash and impulsive acts of violence.

\subsection*{Claudius}
The king of Denmark, Hamlet’s uncle. The villain of the play,
Claudius is a calculating, ambitious politician, adept at
manipulating others for his own ends and willing to execute,
assassinate, or murder to stay in power. He doesn’t understand
Hamlet or Hamlet’s motives, but he is quick to perceive Hamlet as a
threat and take decisive action against him. Claudius does
occasionally show signs of remorse and human feeling—his affection
for Gertrude, for instance, seems sincere.

\subsection*{Gertrude}
The queen of Denmark, Hamlet’s mother, recently married to Claudius.
We never get to observe Gertrude on her own, so we know much more
about how Hamlet feels about her than about how she sees herself.
She seems clearly to love Hamlet, but Hamlet sees her as a weak,
even depraved, woman motivated wholly by lust. Hamlet has such
strong feelings about her sex life that he becomes momentarily
distracted from his revenge quest, urging her toward a life of
chastity.

\subsection*{Polonius}
The Lord Chamberlain of Claudius’s court, and the father of Laertes
and Ophelia. Polonius has good intentions, but he tends to be
somewhat conniving and underhanded. He frequently leaps to the wrong
conclusions, and his speeches are comically pompous and long-winded.
He is completely incapable of figuring out what Hamlet is up to.

\subsection*{Horatio}
Hamlet’s close friend, who studied with the prince at the University
of Wittenberg. Hamlet trusts Horatio above any of the other
characters, valuing him for his even temper and equanimity—qualities
that Hamlet seems to despise in himself. Horatio is loyal and
helpful to Hamlet throughout the play. After Hamlet’s death, Horatio
remains alive to tell Hamlet’s story.

\subsection*{Ophelia}
Polonius’s daughter, a beautiful young woman with whom Hamlet has
been in love. A sweet and innocent young girl, Ophelia dutifully
strives to obey her father and her brother, Laertes, allowing
Polonius to use her in his scheme to spy on Hamlet. When her father
dies, her sanity unravels, and in her madness she paints a scathing
picture of young men as sexually exploitative and unfaithful, and
her mad speeches about flowers conceal implied condemnations of
Claudius and Gertrude.

\subsection*{Laertes}
Polonius’s son and Ophelia’s brother, a young man who spends much of
the play in France. Passionate and quick to action, Laertes is a
foil for the reflective and agonized Hamlet.

\subsection*{Fortinbras}
The young prince of Norway, whose father the king (also named
Fortinbras) was killed by Hamlet’s father (also named Hamlet). Now
Fortinbras wishes to attack Denmark to avenge his father’s honor,
making him another foil for Prince Hamlet. Hamlet admires Fortinbras
for his willingness to fight for no good reason.

\subsection*{The Ghost}
The specter of Hamlet’s recently deceased father. The ghost, who
claims to have been murdered by Claudius, calls upon Hamlet to
avenge him. However, it is not entirely certain whether the ghost is
what it appears to be. Hamlet speculates that the ghost might be a
devil sent to deceive him and tempt him into murder, and the
question of what the ghost is or where it comes from is never
definitively resolved.

\subsection*{Rosencrantz and Guildenstern}
Two slightly bumbling courtiers, former friends of Hamlet from
Wittenberg, who are summoned by Claudius and Gertrude to discover
the cause of Hamlet’s strange behavior.

\subsection*{Osric}
The foolish courtier who summons Hamlet to his duel with Laertes.
His speeches are pretentious and difficult to understand.

\subsection*{Voltimand and Cornelius}
Courtiers whom Claudius sends to Norway to persuade the king to
prevent Fortinbras from attacking.

\subsection*{Marcellus and Barnardo}
The officers who first see the ghost walking the ramparts of
Elsinore and who summon Horatio to witness it. Marcellus is present
when Hamlet first encounters the ghost.

\subsection*{Francisco}
A soldier and guardsman at Elsinore.

\subsection*{Reynaldo}
Polonius’s servant, sent to France by Polonius to check up on and
spy on Laertes.
