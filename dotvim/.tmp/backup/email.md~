There are new instructions for our Zoom meeting:

1. When you enter the Zoom meeting via this link, you will see
   all of the Broadneck Ward youth in the meeting.
2. At some point, there will be "breakout rooms" for each of the youth Sunday
   School classes.  We anticipate that there will be a breakout room called
   "**Course 14**".  Select that room.
