# Idea

For $2k$ long on $2k$ elements,
let $A[0] = 0$.  Order them.
Need to test iff $A[i] > B[i]$
for some $i$.

# Observation

For four, how many possible pairs?

$1$ and $1$: 6
$2$ and $1$: 12
$2$ and $2$: 3   = binomial(4,2) / 2
$3$ and $1$: 4
             --
             25

For seven, how many pairs to test?
