$$
n^2 + 1, n^2 + 3, n^2 + 7, n^2 + 9, n^2 + 13, n^2 + 27

consecutive primes.

Does having all these prime guarantee that
they are consecutive.

If $a+1,a+3$ are prime, then $a+5 = 0 \bmod{3}$.

_Proof_.

$a \neq -1,-3 \bmod{3}$ gives $a = 1 \bmod{3}$. QED

This further rules out $n^2+11,n^2+17,n^2+23$.


Mod $5$ we have

$a \neq -1,-3,-7,-9 = 4,2,3,1$ mod $5$, so $15$ or $25$ don't work.

Mod $7$ we have

$$
n^2 \in \{0,1,2,4\}
$$
We then have
$$
n^2 \neq -1,-3,-7,-9,-13
= 6,4,0,5,6
$$
This gives $n^2 = \in \{2,4\}$ mod $7$.

This gives $a \in 1,2,4$.

***TODO***

If we narrow down mod values on $n$, this could be helpful.
