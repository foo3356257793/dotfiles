# Upcoming Activities



## Tuesday, September 22: Kayaking

Since it is getting dark so early, we want
both middle school and high school groups to be able to enjoy the full time on the water.  We will all meet at the same time and then divide into smaller groups to launch from different locations. 

### When

* 5:30--7 PM

We understand that this activity is earlier than usual so if you have a conflict with the time, we are happy to give rides.  Please let us know.


### Meetup location

* Mill Creek Marina - NSA Annapolis <br/>
Hooper High Rd <br/>
Naval Academy, MD 21402

* Google maps link: <https://goo.gl/maps/cEs2v4YFSjKUzvmFA>

Meet at the covered pavillion (see map).

If you need to park, there is limited parking in a small parking lot to the
east of the meetup location (see map; don't park on the grass) or there is more parking at the Greenbury Nature Center (see map).

For this activity, parents must fill out and sign a permission and medical release form.
There are two options:

1. Parents can drop of their children at the activity and complete the form then.
2. Parents can send their young women to the activity with completed forms.  The form can be found here: [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/church-safety-and-health/permission-and-medical-release-form?lang=eng).
Parents: please remember this if your young women will be carpooling.

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women!
Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November
15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to
participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from
the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with [this
one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe

Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.
