For $0\leq x<1$, define $d_i(x)$ to be the $i$-th digit after the binary point of the binary representation of xx.
For example $d_2(0.25)=1$, $d_i(0.25)=0$ for $i \neq 2$.

Let
$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{d_i(x)}{i^2} \; .
$$

Let $p(a)$ be probability that $f(x)>a$, given that $x$ is uniformly distributed between $0$ and $1$.

Find $p(0.5)$. Give your answer rounded to $8$ digits after the decimal point.

# Ideas

The $i$-th digit is presumably uniform random in $\{0,1\}$.

If $d_1(a) = 1$, then we get $1/1^2 = 1$ and we are good.
We have a probability of $0.5$ of being in this case.

Note that
$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \; .
$$

As a first stab at this, we could compute the digit $i$
such that we must have at least one nonzero before $i$
to have a chance at this.

**next idea**. Suppose we did an exhaust over something like $10$ digits.

**note**.
* First digit one gives it.
* If not, second digit one required.  This case reduces to prob rest at least $1/4$.
