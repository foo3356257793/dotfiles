2 Nephi 1

Talks to Laman and Lemuel.
Mentions their rebellion on the sea.
Blessing: land of promise
Vision: Jerusalem was destroyed.

Covenants America to seed
(Like Israel and the holy land)

It's a land of liberty (for the righteous)

They eventually dwindle in unbelief
and other nations take over this land
