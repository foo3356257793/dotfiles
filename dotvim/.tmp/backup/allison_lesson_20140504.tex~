\title{Why Seek Ye the Living Among the Dead?}

\maketitle

Spring is one of my favorite times of the year.  Even though we live
in San Diego and may not see it as drastically as other places,
after a bleak winter, its so refreshing to see the flowers bloom,
the sun shine brighter, the black white and gray wardrobes we
typically find ourselves wearing during the winter are replaced with
vibrant spring colors and these vibrant colors are seen in stores
and a lot of places we go.  It is a time of rebirth and new life. I
like to think of the play Seven Brides for Seven Brothers around
this time of year.  In the play during the winter, they are all
cooped up in a cabin with snow up to their waists outside.  They are
miserable and easily agitated.  The songs they sing are very somber
and melancholy.  But when spring comes and the snow melts,
everything changes.  The sun is shining.  The birds are singing.
The flowers and grass are vibrant. The animals are giving birth to
their young. The singing and dancing is joyous.  They go to picnics.
Life is renewed and everyone is happy.  .

It is only fitting that Easter falls during the spring.  Christ
experienced a bleak figurative winter as he atoned and paid the
price for every one of our sins.  Then he was betrayed by one of His
disciples, mocked, spat upon, ridiculed, crowned with plaited
thorns, nailed to a cross and eventually died. But, the third day on
a beautiful Spring morning, he rose triumphant from the grave with
new life, having completed all that His Father sent Him to do.  He
conquered death and because He lives, we can live too.

The third day after his crucifixion, Mary and others came to the
tomb with spices that were prepared for the Lord's body.  Luke 24

\begin{quotation}
\noindent 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

\noindent 3 And
they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

\noindent 4 And it
came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two
men stood by them in shining garments:

\noindent 5 And as they were afraid,
and bowed down their faces to the earth, they (meaning the two men)
said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

\noindent 6 He is not
here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet
in Galilee,
\end{quotation}

Just as those women sought the Living Christ in His garden tomb, how
many times do we seek happiness, healing, answers to questions,
pleasure, life essentially  in things that are spiritually draining
or spiritually dead? If we turn to Christ we may drink from the
living waters. He IS the living water.  Just as we find ourselves
physically thirsty sometimes, our spirit thirsts for communion with
God.  The guide to the scriptures teach us that ``as water is
essential to sustaining physical life, the Savior and His teachings
are essential for our eternal life'' and may I add happiness and
living our lives to the fullest here on earth.  We can look to him
and live (Alma 37:47) and if we, do we will live more abundantly
(John 10:10).

Where are some places that we go or things that we do to look for
life? What are some sources of Living Water and how can we tap into
the Living Water?  How does it feel to be thirsty?  How does it feel
to drink water after you're thirsty?  How many times have you
thought at the end of the day ``I've had almost no water today''  and
then you drink a whole bunch of water and vow to drink more the next
day? What are ways to keep Christ our lives all day so we don't
kneel down for our nighttime prayers and think I haven't thought of
Christ once?

Example of anxiety over waiting for an important phone call
regarding our move.  I'm not a very patient person and the waiting
was unbearable.  When it got to the point I couldn't take it
anymore, I knelt in prayer and asked the Lord to make Chris's phone
ring but that if it wasn't His will to make it happen in the
timeline that I wanted, may I have the patience to endure?  Within
the hour, they didn't call but I found a piece of information that
gave us a timeline as to when we could expect to hear from them.  My
anxiety was lifted in that instant and from then on, I was able to
go about my day without any unrest over the  situation.

That is a very real but very trivial example of the point I'm trying
to illustrate.  It could be a big thing. I was really touched by an
example that Emilie Diehl shared last Sunday in Relief Society about
what she learned from her sweet mother who passed away from cancer.
After she was diagnosed, her focus shifted.  She no longer wanted to
watch the movies they all used to watch.  She wanted Emilie to read
her the Book of Mormon. Her focus became the Savior and following
Him.  Even though she may not have been healed physically, she drank
deeply from the living water and thrived spiritually, in the way
that truly matters.

We find another example with Joseph Smith.  In December of 1838
Joseph found himself in some of the most deplorable conditions I
could ever imagine.  For four months in the coldest part of winter
in Missouri, Joseph and several other men were thrown into Liberty
Jail.  They were given no bedding and were forced to sleep on the
cold cement floor with only minimal straw to keep them warm.  Food
was scarce, of poor quality and frequently poisoned.  The ceiling
was barely six feet tall so Joseph could never stand fully upright.
Imagine living in these conditions for four miserable months.  At
this point, Joseph had every right to curse God and turn his back on
Him.  His response was the opposite.  He looked to the Lord in
prayer.  He acknowledged God's power and pleaded with Him for a
reprieve from their situation.  The Lord listened and answered
Joseph reassuring him that he was not forgotten along with some
really great doctrine that we are blessed with today in sections
121-123 of the Doctrine and Covenants.  We may look to these
scriptures during our own trials.  .

Its important to turn to Christ and have Him with us during our
trials.  We cannot survive without Him during them.  Something that
is also important is having Christ in our daily lives.  We can't
survive without Him being part of the little details.  That's the
wonderful thing: he can be in the small details of our lives.  He
can be in the big details of our life and everywhere in between if
we will only let Him in.  The choice is ours to make.

We take the sacrament each week and renew the covenant that we made
with Christ when we were baptized to always remember Him, to look to
Him essentially so that we may always have His spirit to be with us.
It's our responsibility to make sure we keep up our end of the
covenant.

When we look to Christ in the small details of our everyday lives,
our priorities are aligned with the plan God has for us and we can
focus on and accomplish all those things we need to do to be truly
happy.

President Ezra Taft Benson in April of 1988 said:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent When we put God first, all other things fall into their proper place
or drop out of our lives. Our love of the Lord will govern the
claims for our affection, the demands on our time, the interests we
pursue, and the order of our priorities.
\end{quotation}

There are a lot of demands for our time and much claim for our
affection. This is why we need Christ.  We need His help to get our
priorities in order.

Priorities like: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item feasting upon the words of Christ instead of wasting time on other things that have far lesser value.  
	\item truly communing with the Lord in prayer as opposed to just saying your prayers without much thought so you can get to started with your day or get to bed quicker  
	\item devoting time and showing love to our families who may live near or far instead of assuming they know we love them or are thinking of them. 
	\item giving up free time to attend the temple.
	\item being a faithful home and visiting teacher  
	\item being nice to someone even when we feel feel they may not deserve it (like President Pugmire's example last week).  
	\item counting our blessings instead of looking at others and comparing what we may think they have
	\item sharing the gospel with our friends and neighbors
	\item repenting
	\item forgiving
	\item sticking to goals we have made for ourselves
	\item the list goes on$\ldots$
\end{itemize}

These slowly become second nature as we put the Savior first in our
lives and the result of these will be a more abundant life.  It
won't be a life without trials or heartache, but the abundance comes
in peace, happiness and having the spirit to lead and direct our
lives.

I'm all about practical application. We can talk about things until
we're blue in the face but the real question is how can we make
changes in our own lives?  I spent some time with a good friend of
mine this past week and she told me that she was just coming out of
what she called a ``dark week''.  She said she felt like she was
failing every aspect of her life.  Her house was messy, she did not
feel spiritual, she had no motivation to work for her business, no
motivation to take care of herself physically and all she wanted to
do was lay around the house and watch tv.  And that's what she did
for a while until her husband stepped in to help her out.  He told
her that one thing they would challenge people to do on the mission
would be to work on one thing, one commandment they were struggling
with. He suggested that for them as a couple they could  implement a
companionship study and work on praying as a couple.  She said to me
``it's only been two days but I really feel a difference.  Things
aren't perfect but they are getting better.''

I invite you all to look for one or maybe two ways you can work on
looking to Christ and letting Him in your lives.  You will see a
difference, I promise.  I can promise this because God has promised
it to us.

Mosiah 2:41

\begin{quotation}
\noindent 41 And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the
blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God.
For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and
spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are
received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a
state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these
things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Testimony

I know that God lives and that He loves us enough to send His only
begotten Son.  I know that Christ lived on the earth and taught us
how to live a perfect life.  I know this wonderful Easter morning
many years ago, He conquered death and He lives today. How grateful
I am for that knowledge.  I know He is aware of each of us and wants
to do everything that He can to help us succeed.  Because Christ
lives, I know that even though we may have winter in our lives, we
can have spring in our hearts. He knows how to bless our lives and
make them truly abundant if we only look to Him.

Of this I testify, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
