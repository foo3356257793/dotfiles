# How to do this?

Number of possible packings.

## Ideas

The straightforward code is very slow.
There should be a much better algorithm.

At the top level, we can split into ways to
divide up loose bags and not loose bags.

**Update**.
My code is going to take too long to finish.

$f(2) = 1$
$f(3) = 2$.
$f(4) = 5$.

$f(4) = f(3) + 3 \times f(2)$.

**try**

$f(n) = f(n-1) + {{n-1}\choose{2}} f(n-2) + {{n-3}\choose{4}} f(n-4)$.

**again**.

Have a set of number of arrangements into odd and even number of bags.


**still slow**.

I have

$f_{odd}(n) = \sum_{p even} {n-1}\choose{p} f_{even}(p) f_{even}(n-1-p)$
$f_{even}(n) = \sum_{p even} {n-1}\choose{p} f_{even}(p) f_{odd}(n-1-p)$

# New ideas

We can write

$$
f(24680) =
\sum_{p even}
{{24679}\choose{p}} f_{even}(p) f(24679-p)
$$

# Alternating permutations

Permutations which go only up/down.

The number of these seem to match the solution here.  Why?

1324
1423
2314
2413
3412

1,2,3,4
(1,2)-3,4
(1,3)-4,2
(1,2)-4,3
(2,3)-4,1

(1,2)-3,4 <-> 1423
(2,3)-4,1 <-> 1324
