Find the minimum number of multiplications to compute $n^k$.

## Idea

Figure out the number of multiplications
for the binary method.

Use branching to see if we can beat this method.

## Results

$m(2k) = m(k) + 1$.

_Proof_.

To at least achieve this, build $n^k$
and then square it.

??Don't know how to prove the converse??

**idea**.

This is an NP hard problem.
