I was wondering about Jasper.  He still needs to complete Duty to
God in action for his arrow of light.  I was wondering if we need to
take immediate action on this. His birthday is this week; I know
that we have some flexibility in getting his requirements completed,
but I am not sure how much flexibility we have.  Some of the
requirements mention things he needs to do for a month, so it seems
like it might take a while to complete this.  I don't think we will
both be available to do this together for the next couple weeks, so
I am wondering whether we need to do something sooner.

I have a few cub scout things do update you on, as well as a question.

This next week, den meetings have been cancelled because it is close to the holiday.

I will be out of town the following week, so I will not be able to make it to the meeting.
