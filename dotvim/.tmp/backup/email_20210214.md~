Dear <name>,

Thank you so much for contributing your talents to the YW/YM Masked Singer activity. We are excited to hear you perform!  This is what the structure of the night will look like:

<div style="font-size: 2em; margin-top: 1.0em; margin-bottom: 1.0em">
<center>
**Your turn is <turn>.**
</center>
</div>

When it is your turn, you will have up to 2.5 minutes to perform.  Take as much or as little of that time as you need.

If you know what your pseudonym will be for the activity, please let me know
beforehand.  If not, I will ask you to send it to me privately during the
activity before we start.

THANK YOU for participating and sharing your talents with us!!

If you have any questions, please let me know:

Allison Nelson <br /> (858) 345-0936 <br /> <sully1234@gmail.com>
