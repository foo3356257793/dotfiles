Story of Ammon

Tools: we can be tools to do Heavenly Father's work
Alma 17:11

> And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren,
> and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and
> afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will
> make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.
