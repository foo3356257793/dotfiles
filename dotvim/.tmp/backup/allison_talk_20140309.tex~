Just been called to serve as RSP and it has been a growing
experience but I have enjoyed it so far.  I love the Relief Society
and always have.  My patriarchal blessing says that the woman's
organization will be a joy to my heart and that statement continues
to be fulfilled.  I remember walking into my first RS broadcast and
being overcome by the spirit even before it began.  I knew  RS was
something special.  RS gets a bad rep sometimes as stuffy and boring
but its not that at all to me.  The Lord prefers to minister to us
one by one and the Relief Society has been organized so that can be
accomplished.  Sisters looking out for sisters.  It's a divinely
instituted organization and I'm grateful to be a part of it.

In the Sunday session of General Conference, President Eyring spoke
of the his grandchildren getting married which caused deep
contemplation because they were asking him for advice.  He said that
they were essentially asking him “What choices can I make that will
lead me to happiness? He explains that Heavenly Father has made us
all unique and different. It's true.  We are all vastly different.
We come from different backgrounds.  We all think differently.  We
have different strengths and weakness. Different talents.  Yet, as
President Eyring states “a loving Heavenly Father has set the same
path for happiness for all of his children.” That path, he
continues, “is to follow all the commandments of God.”

He explains that there is one “overarching commandment” that will
lead us to lead a happy life.  He quotes Matthew 22:35-40

\begin{quotation}
“Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,

“Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

“This is the first and great commandment.

“And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

“On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”
\end{quotation}

He says its not hard to summarize how we, God's children, can find
happiness. We need to ask ourselves “What choices have led me toward
loving the Lord God with all my heart and soul and with all my
mind?”  In that we find our happiness.

I want to talk about one choice that we can make that will help us
show the Lord that we love him with all our heart, mind and soul and
that is through the temple.

There is a precious commodity that we have all been given and a lot
of times it's value is forgotten or trivialized.  Unlike other
precious commodities, we all have been given the same amount. Yet
some seem to be able to do more with theirs.   Technology has even
made it so we even have more of this precious gem yet we always seem
to come up in short of it.  I'm talking about time. We can show love
to God by choosing to carve out moments in our packed days, weeks,
months to spend time with Him in His house  Sometimes our time is
worth more than gold or silver.  If you think back to those old
commercials that the church put out about families, you'll remember
the slogan “Isn't it about...time?” Elder Boyd K. Packer said in his
talk that I'll be quoting “When you enter any dedicated temple, you
are in the house of the Lord.” Heavenly Father is just that our
Father.  He loves it when we make the effort to work on our
relationship with him in His house. He loves it when we visit.

Time has been on my mind lately because I feel like I never have
enough.  Just earlier this week I was going through a mental
checklist of everything that I had going on and everything that I
wanted to accomplish, projects and tasks to be completed and I
thought, I need more days.  I need more time.  It is not a mystery
that it is difficult sometimes to make it to the temple.  It
requires faith on our part and sacrifice.  But, as it says in one of
the great hymns Praise to the Man, sacrifice brings forth the
blessings of heaven.  And there are so many blessings through our
temple attendance.  Temple attendance is not only how we can show
our love to God, it is how He shows His love to us.

What are some of the blessings of the temple?  There are many but I
want to talk about just a couple of them in the time I have left.

\subsection*{The temple is a place where we can feel closer to our
	Heavenly Father and be reminded that we are in fact, his sons and
daughters.}

We are reminded in the temple of our true relationship with God,
that He has a plan for us and not only desires to bless our lives
but has the power to do so.

\subsection*{The temple is a place of peace.}

When we enter into the temple, we leave the world behind. Our daily
troubles and cares are left at the door and we can sit and feel the
added measure of the spirit that will bring peace to our hearts.

\subsection*{The temple is a house of prayer.}

Boyd K. Packer said:

\begin{quotation}
“We may receive answers to our heart-felt questions if we go to the
temple with a sincere desire to obtain them. There, the Holy Ghost
may grant us added light and knowledge and the privilege of
receiving the answers to the problems and trials the world
presents.“When members of the Church are troubled or when crucial
decisions weigh heavily upon their minds, it is a common thing for
them to go to the temple. It is a good place to take our cares. In
the temple we can receive spiritual perspective. There, during the
time of the temple service, we are 'out of the world.'
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{The temple is a place to regain an eternal perspective.}

“Sometimes our minds are so beset with problems, and there are so
many things clamoring for attention at once that we just cannot
think clearly and see clearly. At the temple the dust of distraction
seems to settle out, the fog and the haze seem to lift, and we can
'see' things that we were not able to see before and find a way
through our troubles that we had not previously known.

Since the temple is the Lord's house, there is an added measure of
the spirit that allows us to receive inspiration and revelation that
cannot happen anywhere else.

\subsection*{We can serve and show love to our ancestors by completing saving
ordinances of the gospel.}

\subsection*{The Lord, in the temple, gives men through the priesthood the power
	to bind on heaven that which is bound on earth.  We can be together
with our families forever.}

\subsection*{We can leave the temple armed with power.}

Doctrine and Covenants 109:22

\begin{quotation}
22 And we ask thee, Holy Father, that thy servants may go forth from
this house armed with thy power, and that thy name may be upon
them, and thy glory be round about them, and thine angels have
charge over them;
\end{quotation}

Elder Packer states: “The Lord will bless us as we attend to the
sacred ordinance work of the temples. Blessings there will not be
limited to our temple service. We will be blessed in all of our
affairs”

\section*{NOT WITHOUT OPPOSITION}

Boyd K. Packer stated:

\begin{quotation}
“Temples are the very center of the spiritual strength of the
Church. We should expect that the adversary will try to interfere
with us as a church and with us individually as we seek to
participate in this sacred and inspired work. Temple work brings so
much resistance because it is the source of so much spiritual power
to the Latter-day Saints and to the entire Church.”

The adversary is pushing against us to keep us away from the temple.
We need to push back, brothers and sisters.  If you have never been
to the temple, I encourage you to make that your goal and work
towards it.  If there are questions of worthiness that are keeping
you from temple service, I encourage you to take the steps to
correct them and get back.  If you are able to attend the temple, I
encourage you to take a look at your busy schedules and see if there
is more time that can be etched out for temple service.
