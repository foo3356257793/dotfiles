# Things I learned about

### gdb

Lots of notes about this.

### factoring

`pari` and `flint` have functions
`flint` seems easier to use

### dynamic arrays

C++ has this: `std::vec`.  You can just take C code,
plop in this feature, and don't worry.

(I wrote C code which took advantage of the fact
that I new by hand how long the array needed to be
and it was faster than the modified C++ version.)

### libraries

Here is an example

``
$(CC) -I/usr/include/libpari23 -L/usr/lib64/libpari23.so -lpari23 -g $+ -o $@
``

I figured out where these things were.


### hash

I used a library `utt_hash` from the internet to implement a hash table.

I also learned about using C++ for this.  `std::map` gives a dictionary
and `std::unordered_set` gives an unordered set (which is actually what
I wanted on a specific problem).
