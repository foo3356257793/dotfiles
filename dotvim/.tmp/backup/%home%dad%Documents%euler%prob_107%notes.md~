**Greedy**. Remove the largest lines which don't affect connectivity.

# Another idea

Look at the smallest weight edge.
Accept that edge and collapse the resulting nodes
down.

_Proof_.
Consider an optimal network.
Assume it doesn't contain the minimal edge.

Project down to the collapsed network.
The projection connects the collapsed network with
two edges to the collapsed point: there is at least one edge through
the points on the uncollapsed network, and we aren't using the minimal
edge connecting the two.  We would then have a connected network
on the collapse by removing one of the edges.
