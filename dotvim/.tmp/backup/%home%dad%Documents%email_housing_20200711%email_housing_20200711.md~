Hi,

We are attaching a copy of the closing cost details.

We previously discussed splitting the costs except for the items that are considered only our responsibility (example: loan origination charges).  On the form we are attaching, it looks like this is Items B, C, and E.  The total listed for these is $6805.  If we split these, that comes to $3402.50 each.

We are in a unique situation in that we recently completed a PCS.  Part of our entitlement for that is reimbursement for some of the costs of buying a home in our new duty station.  It seems like, however, that we will only be reimbursed for the half of the costs which we, the buyers, pay and not for the sellers half.  We wanted to bounce the following idea off of you.  What if we agreed to have us, the buyers, pay all of the closing costs, and in exchange you lowered the sale price somewhat.  For example, instead of paying $3400 in closing costs, maybe you could lower the sale price by $3000?  What do you think?



Thanks!


Chris and Allison Nelson
