\maketitle

Sometimes good things happen to us.
For example, yesterday, I enjoyed going on a family scoot,
bike ride, and walk.

Sometimes bad things happen to us.
For example, some kids are sad that they don't
get to be with their friends at school now that we
have home school.

One word for bad things like this is afflictions.
In the scriptures, the Lord said

\begin{quotation}
  I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.
  (Mosiah 24:14)
\end{quotation}

Sometimes when afflictions happen to me, I say a lot of prayers,
and I feel a good feeling in my heart.  This helps me feel better.

This is one of the reasons we are supposed to say prayers.  Our
prayers can help us feel better when we are sad.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
