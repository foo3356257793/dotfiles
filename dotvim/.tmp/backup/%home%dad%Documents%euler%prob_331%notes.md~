# Ideas

See if I can do $n=10$ by hand.

## Idea

In a lot of cases the rank is $1$.

***TODO*** Check this

It suffices to find any solution.

Join together thin blocks and solve the smaller subproblem.

Suppose we have

[0 0 1]
[0 * 0]
[1 0 0]

Apply some operations on the middle block to get

[0 1 1]
[1 0 1]
[1 1 0]

Then flip the corners to get

[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 0]

**Problem**. In the $N=10$ example, we can't do the suggested middle transform.

Think about how to solve

[ 0 0 0 ]
[ 0 1 0 ]
[ 0 0 0 ]

or

[ 0 0 0 0 ]
[ 0 1 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 0 0 ]
[ 0 0 0 0 ]
