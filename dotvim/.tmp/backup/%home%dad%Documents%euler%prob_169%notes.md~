# Sparse

The binary representation is sparse.

What if we have $1000B$.

If we use a top power, we reduce to $B$.

If we don't we must use at least one next power to get
$0100B$.
In this case, we reduce to $100B$.  Note that the limit of
$2$ doesn't matter on the top digit.

If we have a $10B$,
then cases:

Eliminate the top digit directly and get $B$.

Use the next digit to get $1B$.

If we have a $11B$, cases:

Eliminate the top digit directly and get $B$.

Rule out only using one from below:

$10B$ and the highest is $011...$

Hence need $2$ and we get

$01B$.  We then need to use at least one of the next ones
and branch depending.

# Idea

Each representation corresponds uniquely to a decomposition
$n = a+b$ where $a&b=a$:

$b$ is sum of powers used at all, $a$ is sum of powers used twice.
