</center>

The young women will have an opportunity to ride on a boat at this activity.
For this part of the activity, parents must fill out and sign a permission and medical release form.
There are two options:

1. Parents can drop of their children at the activity and complete the form then.
2. Parents can send their young women to the activity with completed forms.  The form can be found here: [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/church-safety-and-health/permission-and-medical-release-form?lang=eng).
Parents: please remember this if your young women will be carpooling.

We repeat: this form must be completed for each young woman who
wants to ride the boat.

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women!
Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November
15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to
participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from
the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with [this
one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


##### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

##### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe

Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.
