We can find a single solution via LLL.


If we want to find length $\leq L$, we need

$|\vv_1| + |\vv_2| + |\vv_3| \leq L$.
The maximum $L_2$ square norm is $L^2$, then.
We can enumerate all solutions up to this bound
(and easily b/c it's a dimension $2$ lattice).

We then have to really pump out these operations.

**cycle?**

Can we figure out when
$x_n = 0, x_{n+1} = 0, x_{n+2} = 1$?

$(x,y,z) |-> (x+y+z, x+2y+2z, 2x + 3y + 4z)$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 2 & 2\\
2 & 3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
$$
