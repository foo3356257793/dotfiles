How to solve:
$$
1/x + 1/y = 1/n
$$

This reduces to
$$
n(y + x) = xy
$$
We get
$$
xy - nx - ny
=
(x-n)(y-n) - n^2
$$
so
$$
(x-n)(y-n) = n^2 \; .
$$

For $n=4$, there are three solutions.


**Why?**

Factor $16$ and get 3 unique pairs of factorizations:
$(1,16), (2,8), (4,4)$.

The question is then how many pairs of factorizations are there.

**Number of factorizations**.

Given

$$
p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_n^{a_n}
$$
the number of factors is
$$
(a_1+1)\cdots(a_n+1) \; .
$$

A strong candidate is the product of the first $11$ primes.
We might search for better.

*remark*.
I am forgetting about the $n^2$ part of this.

In the simple formulation, the number of factors will be
$$
3^{\#\text{primes}}
$$
