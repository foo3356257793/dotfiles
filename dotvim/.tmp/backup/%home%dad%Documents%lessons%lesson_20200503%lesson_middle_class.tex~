\subsection{Scripture and Thought}

\paragraph{Mosiah 9:17}

Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle
against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the
Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for
we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.

\paragraph{Thoughts.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item We are going through hard times.  Many of us are struggling
    with being quarantined.
  \item In the scripture story, they remembered God and tried their
    hardest to get Him to help.
  \item Heavenly Father answers prayers.  The Holy Ghost can help us
    understand God's will.
