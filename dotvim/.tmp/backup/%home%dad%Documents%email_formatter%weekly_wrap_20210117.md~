# In-person activities on hold

As Bishop Chard announced at today's ward devotional,
we will not be holding in-person activities for the time being.
Instead, we will be holding virtual activities on the first
and third Tuesdays of each month.  These activities will be combined
with the Young Men.

Also, the previously announced For the Strength of Youth (FSY) conference will
be postponed to 2022.

During this virtual version of The Masked Singer, you will be
treated to musical performances by some of our Young Women, Young Men,
and maybe some of our leaders.  The catch: the performers' identities
will be a mystery.  We will have fun guessing which of our friends are
behind each "mask".
