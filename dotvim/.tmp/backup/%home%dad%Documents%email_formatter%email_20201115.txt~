Hi Brother Buhler,


I wanted to communicate an issue and ask for some coordination.


First, I wanted to report that there was some confusion with our SS
class today.  At 1 PM, a number of younger-aged youth logged on who
were not in our class and we were told that the YM/YW gave them a
link.  We told them they were in the incorrect class and they left
the meeting.  Only one of our regular class members ended up in our
meeting, so we cancelled the class for the day.

Could you clarify what is the Sunday School's current plan for
advertising youth Sunday School classes.

First, I want to communicate that as a SS teacher I do not have
access to the class lists on the Tools app.  My belief is that
function of the app is only for those in leadership positions.

Second, I want to make a suggestion that it would be nice if there
were an email which went out in the days before each class to remind
everyone and to list the correct links.  One convenient way to do
this is if there were a single person in charge of sending an email
to all youth, parents, and leaders listing the links for all three
youth SS classes.

Speaking of links, I noticed in your email you didn't have our link.
Here it is:

Could we also advertise the youth SS classes in the ward
bulletin?

Thanks,

Chris Nelson
