# Problem

$$
(a+b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
+
(a-b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
=
1
$$

How can we solve this?

Let's say
$$
x + y = 1
$$
where
$$
x^3 = a+b\sqrt{c}
y^3 = a-b\sqrt{c}
$$
so
$$
x^3+y^3 = 2a
$$
$$
(x^3-y^3)^2 = 4b^2c
$$

We get
$$
x^3+y^3 = x^2 + xy + y^2 = 2a
$$
and
$$
(x-y)^2(x^2 - xy + y^2)^2 = 4b^2c
$$

$$
(x-y)^2(xy - a)^2 = b^2c
$$

Continue
$$
(x^2 - 2xy + y^2)(x^2y^2 - 2axy + a^2) = b^2c
$$


**example**.
They claim
$$
(2 + \sqrt{5})^{1/3}
+
(2 - \sqrt{5})^{1/3}
=
1 \; .
$$
How can we see this algebraically?

Equivalent to
$$
(2 + \sqrt{5})
+
3 (4-5)^{1/3} (2+\sqrt{5})^{1/3}
3 (4-5)^{1/3} (2-\sqrt{5})^{1/3}
+
(2 - \sqrt{5})
=
1
$$
which does reduce to the relation.

In general we get
$$
(a + b\sqrt{c})
+
(a - b\sqrt{c})
+
3 (a^2 -b^2c)^{1/3} (a+b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
+
3 (a^2 -b^2c)^{1/3} (a-b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
=
(a+b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
+
(a-b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
$$

This gives
$$
2a
=
\left(
1
- 3 (a^2 - b^2c)^{1/3}
\right)
\left(
    (a+b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
    +
    (a-b\sqrt{c})^{1/3}
\right)
$$
This requires that
$$
2a = 1 -3 (a^2 - b^2c)^{1/3}
$$

This forces $a^2 - b^2c$ to be a cube.

For choices of $a,b$ we then are forced into using choices
of $c$ to make a cube.  An actually
$$
\left(-\frac{2a-1}{3}\right)^3 = (a^2 - b^2c)
$$
Forces a unique choice of $c$.

**Note**.
We get
$$
\left(\frac{2a-1}{3}\right)^3 + a^2 = b^2c
$$
We can factor this thing, then, to figure out what $b$ and $c$
could be.  This is particularly restrictive on $b$ as we need square factors
for $b$.

*Note*.
It isn't that expensive to do $b=1$.

*Note*.  We need $2a=1 \mod 3$, so $a=3k+2$.
Then,
$$
\frac{2(3k+2)-1}{3}
=
\frac{6k+4-1}{3}
=
2k+1 \; .
$$
This gives
$$
(2k+1)^3 + (3k+2)^2
=
8k^3 + 21 x^2 + 18 x + 5
=
(8k+5) (k+1)^2 = b^2 c
$$

One solution is $b = k+1$ and $c=8k+5$.

# My idea

Exhaust $k$.
Factor $(8k+5)$ and $(k+1)$.

Branch over square factors to pick $b$ and $c$.

*Note*.
If $a=3k+2$ and $b=k+1$ and $c=8k+5$,
then the perimeter is
$$
12k + 8
$$
and we can count how many are like this.
Maybe this isn't a major savings?

*TODO*.
Use parallel programming and cython to speed this up.

## Bound

If
$$
(8k+5)(k+1)^2 = b^2c
$$
then the smallest we can make $b+c$ is
about $2k$.
