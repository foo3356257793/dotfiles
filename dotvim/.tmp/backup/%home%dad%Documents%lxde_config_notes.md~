# TODO

* launch programs via keyboard
* keyboard shortcuts for favorite programs
* panel on top?
* how to do workspaces
* snapping windows (include gaps?)
* make it look a lot nicer
* move windows with keyboard shortcuts?
* some tmux commands don't seem to work b/c blocked by the desktop environment

## For kids

One idea is that this setup could be more stable than GNOME
(which seems to struggle with multiple users)

* dock
* easy way to find all of the applications (games)
