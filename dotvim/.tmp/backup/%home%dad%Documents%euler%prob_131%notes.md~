Find primes $p$ with
$$
n^3 + n^2 p
$$
a cube.

If
$$
n^3 + n^2 p = (n+m)^3
$$
Then
$$
n^3 + n^2 p = n^3 + 3n^2m + 3nm^2 + m^3
n^2(p-3m) + n(-3m^2) - m^3 = 0
$$
This gives
$$
9m^4 - 4(p-3m)(-m^3)
=
9m^4 + 4(p-3m)m^3
=
-3m^4 + 4pm^3
$$
a square.
This gives
$$
-3m^2 + 4pm
$$
a square.

**Note**.

When is
$$
(n+r)^3 > n^3 + n^2p
$$
We have
$$
n^3 + 3n^2r + 3nr^2 + r^3 > n^3 + n^2p
$$
It is sufficient for $3r > p$.

We also need $(n+r)^3 \equiv n^3 \bmod{p}$.

*Idea*.

For each $n$, there is at most one prime for which this holds.

*Question.*

Mod $p$ we need multiple cube roots of things.
This suggests what?

At least need $p \equiv 1 \bmod{3}$.

**note**.

If $q | n$, need $q | m$.
If $q^k | n$, need $q^{ceil(2k/3)} | m$.

*but*.

We cannot have $q|n$ but $q^2 \not| n$.
If $q^2 | n$, then RHS divisible by $q^4$.
This doesn't work either.
If $q^3 | n$, then RHS divisible by $q^2$,
and so $q^2 | m$.

$q^4 -> q^8$
$q^5 -> q^10$
$q^6 -> q^12 -> q^6$.

This suggests that $n$ always has to be a cube itself.

$k^9 + k^6 p$.
This gives
$$
k^6 (k^3 + p)
$$
a cube, which holds iff $k^3 + p$ is a cube.

In our example, $k=2$, and indeed $p=19$ gives
$19+8=27$ is a cube.

We need
$$
k^3 + p \geq (k+1)^3
$$
which gives
$$
p \geq 3k^2 + 3k + 1
$$
which gives an upper bound on $k$.


**note**.

Have

m^3 - n^3 = n^2 p

(m-n)(m^2+mn+n^2) = n^2 p

Should have a solution to $x^2+x+1$


***Idea***.

Look at cubes up to (10^{6/3}) and take differences.  See which differences
are prime (and below the desired bound).

# DONE

There is an even easier thing to do.
