If you have not registered yet and would still like to attend, you can! If you can't attend all the meetings, still register and attend what you can! If you are on the fence about going, register anyway so you have the option! Here is the link to the registration form: <https://forms.gle/FsUdtQhCesNXqF9z6>.


The stake, ward and youth camp leaders are working hard behind the scenes to make this year of girls camp, although different than normal, totally awesome!

# On our radar

This year our church will be celebrating 150 years of amazing young women! Part of our celebration will include a special Face to Face broadcast November 15th, 2020. Young women, parents, and young women leaders are invited to participate.

In the months leading up to the broadcast, watch for special invitations from the Young Women General Presidency, beginning with
[this one](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/face-to-face?lang=eng).


#### Invitation Leading to the Broadcast

**My 150**: Think of something you can do related to the number 150. It can be very simple, but meaningful, like 150 kind messages, reading 150 verses of scripture, or 150 kind acts of service.

#### Share Your Ideas Using #strivetobe
Post your ideas and stories on social media using #strivetobe. Look for more challenges in the months leading to the broadcast.
