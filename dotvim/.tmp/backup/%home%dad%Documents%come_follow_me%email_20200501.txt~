Hi Kasey (and Rob),

I wanted to coordinate our virtual Sunday School this Sunday for the
middle youth class.

First, what is the best way going forward to communicate with the
class during the week.  It might be nice to have an email list with
all of the class members as well as their parents.

Do we already have a link for a zoom meeting?

As far as the teaching (or discussion leading) responsibilities this
week, I can do that.

Also, since we are supposed to have two-deep leadership on this
video call, I wanted to make sure we are going to be all set.
Kasey, are you going to be available for this?


Thanks,

Chris Nelson
