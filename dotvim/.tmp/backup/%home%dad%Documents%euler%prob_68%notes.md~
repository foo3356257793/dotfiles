Searching for $16$ digit strings.

There are $10$ entries, so we get at least a $10$ digit string
from using one digit entries.

If the sum is at least $100+2(99)$, each triple needs at least $4$ digits.
This at least pushes to $13$ digits.

# Algorithm

Given a perp vector to the matrix, compute the maximal $k$
such that we have a $16$ digit string.  If there is no such feasible
$k$, what can we conclude?

# Actually

We can only fill in the numbers $1$ through $10$.

Try the following.
Fill in in order.

[0,1,2,3] imply [4].  Check that this works.
Fill in [5].  Implies [6] (check).
Fill in [7]. Implies [8] (check).
Check [9].

**note**.

If they were all $1$ digit, we would get a $15$ digit string.
Having $10$ be one of the choices gives $16$ digits.  If $10$ is in
a choice used twice, we get $9$ digits.
