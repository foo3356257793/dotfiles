  # automated
  cat dconf-settings.ini | dconf load /

  mouse: tap to click
  go through all of the keyboard shortcuts

* Done

  *Headers*. I can get rid of these.  I also tweaked these to be really small
  so that I at least have the option of using them.

  See .config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css

  *Update*. I turned this off for now.

  Super+Drag is a way to move windows.  Easy with the trackpoint.
  I also have snapping:
    - Super+h/l: Snap left or right
    - Super+k: Maximize
    - Super+j: Restore

  *Update*. Installed ubuntu.  Don't know how to make the headers all like
  this.  Just using the regular headers now.

  *move window*.
    - Super-m puts in move window mode
    - Super-r puts in resize window mode
    - shift-arrow does large chunks of movement
    - It would be nice to have keyboard shortcuts to do moves

  *chrome*

    Need to learn chrome shortcuts better
    - ctrl-t         : open new tab and start typing
    - ctrl-w         : close tab
    - ctrl-tab       : goto tab left
    - ctrl-shift-tab : goto tab right
    - alt-arrow      : go back/forward in browsing history

    *tmux*
    - it is in a pretty good state

    *keyboard shortcuts*
    - this is coming along nicely

    *web apps*
    - the scriptures
    - gnome shell extensions

** things that don't matter to me anymore

    customize the login screen
    - the fedora version seems fine

    move window with keyboard: the arrow keys move it so slowly
    - shift seems to make it move in chunks
    - snapping is not that bad (especially with transparent terminal)

* Todo

Widget for timers

be able to print from system utils
  - google cloud print will go away
  - be able to scan??? (I can scan from phone)

Fully refine the theme
  - 1977 openbox analog
  - go xorg session for this?

* BACKBURNER

look into anbox for android apps
- or don't: this doesn't seem to be that great
