## Tuesday, December 15: White elephant gift exchange

Also we want to remind you of the activity on Tuesday. We will be having a white elephant gift exchange so please be thinking of a unique, funny or odd gift to exchange of no more than \$5 value. Please let us know if you need help with coming up with ideas. We are also happy to help if you cannot provide one.
