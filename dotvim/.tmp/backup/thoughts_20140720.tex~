\section{Scripture Study}

It has been difficult to stay motivated and carve out time to do it.

\subsection{Faith}

The big way in which I exercise faith is to do things I nominally
believe in.  I have faith as I follow spiritual promptings.  I am
faithless when I ignore promptings and just do what I want.

I believe in scripture study, but I need to have a lot more faith in
it so that I do it regularly and give it the proper attention it
needs.

\subsubsection{Hardcore Week}

It was a little over a year ago that I embarked on having a
``hardcore'' week where I only did things that were good.  I had
some subsequent weeks where I followed up on it.  In my year of
working, however, I lost it and got lazy.

In general I believe in the concept of only doing good things and
not being lazy.  I fully recognize that I need to change my current
ways.
