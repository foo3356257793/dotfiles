During this virtual version of The Masked Singer, you will be
treated to musical performances by some of our Young Women, Young Men,
and maybe others.  The catch: the performers' identities
will be a mystery.  We will have fun guessing which of our friends are
behind each "mask".

### Zoom

* Zoom Meeting ID: 842 2086 0137

### More details

#### Everyone will be "masked"

After opening exercises, we will
"mask" everyone in the meeting:

1. The host will share her screen, hiding everyone's video.
2. Everyone, including the audience, will
   either turn off their camera or point their screens at the
   ceiling/wall to hide their face.
3. Everyone will also change their screen name to something
   fun to hide their identity.

#### The game

1. The masked performers will perform in an order coordinated ahead of time.
2. Each performance will be at most 2.5 minutes.
3. After each performance, the audience will have 1 minute to send the host a
   yes/or no question to gather more information about the
   performer's identity.
   The host will ask three of these questions,
   which the performer will answer in chat.
4. The audience guess the performer's identity in
   chat.
5. The performer will then turn on their camera and reveal themselves.
