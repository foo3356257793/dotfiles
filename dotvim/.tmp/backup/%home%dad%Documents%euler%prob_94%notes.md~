# area of triangle

A triangle
$$
n,n,n+1
$$
has what area?

The base is $(n+1)$ and the height is given by
$$
n^2 + ((n+1)/2)^2 = h^2
$$
The area is
$$
(1/2) (n+1) h
$$
We have
$$
4n^2 + (n+1)^2 = 4h^2
$$
If $4h^2$ is an integral square, then what?
If $(n+1)$ is odd, then fail.  We can then
restrict to $(n+1)$ even.  In this case, just test
$$
n^2 + ((n+1)/2)^2 = h^2
$$
a square.

Also note, test for
$$
5n^2 + 2n + 1
$$
a square, $n$ odd.

**Efficiency**.

Need
$$
3n+1 \leq 10^9
$$
Making $n$ odd pushes the search down to
$27$ bits.  We would like more savings.

**Again**

$$
h^2 + ((n+1)/2)^2 = n^2
$$

$$
4h^2 + (n+1)^2 = 4n^2
$$

$$
4h^2 = 3n^2 - 2n - 1 = (n-1)(3n+1)
$$

We need $n-1$ to be square or $2$ times a square.
